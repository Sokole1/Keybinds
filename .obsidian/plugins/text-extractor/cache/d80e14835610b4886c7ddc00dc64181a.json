Please check the submission day/time on Canvas. §2.1, §2.4, §2.5 1. (The method of reduction of order). The following equation (1 − t2) d2y dt2 + 2t dy dt − 2y = 0, (1) has a solution y1(t) = t. If we assume y2(t) = y1(t)v(t) is another solution, we ﬁnd that v(t) satisﬁes tv′′ + ( 2 + 2t2 1 − t2 ) v′ = 0. Hence w = v′ satisﬁes w′ + ( 2 t + 2t 1 − t2 ) w = 0. (a) Solve w and v. You may assume w > 0 and 0 < t < 1 for simplicity. Answer. The equation of w′ is separable. Integrating dw w = − 2 t − 2t 1 − t2 , we get (using w > 0) ln w = −2 ln t + ln(1 − t 2) Hence w = 1 − t2 t2 , v = ∫ 1 − t2 t2 dt = ∫ 1 t2 − 1dt = − 1 t − t + C W may choose C = 0. Then y2(t) = tv(t) = −1 − t2. Note: Once we have found y2(t), we can check that it is a solution also for t ∈ (−1, 1). (b) Solve (1) with the initial conditions y(0) = 3 and y′(0) = −4. Answer. The general solution is y(t) = c1y1(t) + c2y2(t) = c1t − c2(1 + t 2). Thus y′(t) = c1 − 2c2t. The initial conditions give y(0) = −c2 = 3 and y′(0) = c1 = −4. Thus c1 = −4, c2 = −3, and y(t) = −4t − (−3)(1 + t2) = 3t2 − 4t + 3. 2. 2.4.2: Consider a mass and spring system with a mass m = 2, spring constant k = 3, and damping constant c = 1. a) Set up and ﬁnd the general solution of the system. b) Is the system underdamped, overdamped or critically damped? c) If the system is not critically damped, ﬁnd a c that makes the system critically damped. Answer. a). Let x(t) be the displacement of the mass at time t. By the assumption, our diﬀerential equation is: mx′′ + cx ′ + kx = 2x′′ + x′ + 3x = 0. 1 The characteristic equation of 2x′′ + x′ + 3x = 0 is: 2r2 + r + 3 = 0. Solving 2r2 + r + 3 = 0, we have r1 = −1 + √1 − 4 · 2 · 3 4 = −1 + i √23 4 , and r2 = −1 − i √23 4 . So the general solution to 2x′′ + x′ + 3x = 0 is: x(t) = C1e− t 4 cos ( √23 4 t ) + C2e − t 4 sin ( √23 4 t ) . b). Since 1 − 4 · 2 · 3 = −23 < 0, the system is underdamped . c). In order to make the system to be critically damped, that is, c 2 − 4 · 2 · 3 = 0. Then c = √24 = 2 √6 . 3. 2.4.6: Suppose you wish to measure the friction a mass of 0.1 kg experiences as it slides along a ﬂoor (you wish to ﬁnd c). You have a spring with spring constant k = 5 N/m. You take the spring, you attach it to the mass and ﬁx it to a wall. Then you pull on the spring and let the mass go. You ﬁnd that the mass oscillates with frequency 1 Hz. What is the friction? Answer. It’s easy to see that our diﬀerential equation is: 0.1x′′ + cx ′ + 5x = 0. Rewrite the equation as x′′ + 10cx ′ + 50x = 0. By the assumption, we know that our motion is underdamped with frequency 1 Hz, which implies that (10c)2 − 4 · 50 < 0 and 1 · 2π = √ 4 · 50 − (10c)2 2 = √200 − 100c2 2 = √ 50 − 25c2. So we get 25c2 = 50 − 4π2, that is, c = √ 2 − 4π2 25 ≈ 0.648. Hence the friction is 0.648 . 4. 2.4.101: A mass of 2 kilograms is on a spring with spring constant k newtons per meter with no damping. Suppose the system is at rest and at time t = 0 the mass is kicked and starts traveling at 2 meters per second. How large does k have to be to so that the mass does not go further than 3 meters from the rest position? 2 Answer. The only force acting on the spring is the spring compression force so the diﬀerential equation is mx′′ = −kx where m = 2 kg is the mass and k is the spring constant. The spring is initially uncompressed so x(0) = 0, and it was kicked at a velocity of 2 m/s so x′(0) = 2. Therefore the initial value problem we have to solve is x′′(t) + k m x(t) = 0, x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 2. The general solution is x(t) = A cos(√ k m x) + B sin (√ k m x) . The initial conditions give 0 = x(0) = A, 2 = x′(0) = √ k m B, so A = 0 and B = 2 √m/k. Therefore the solution is x(t) = 2 √ m k sin (√ k m x) . A maximum displacement of 3 m means that |x(t)| ≤ 3 ⇐⇒ 2√ m k ≤ 3 =⇒ k ≥ 4m 9 = 8 9 . Therefore to ensure the mass doesn’t go farther than 3 m from the rest position we must have k ≥ 8 9 N/m . 5. 2.5.2: Find a particular solution of y′′ − y′ − 6y = e2x. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − y′ − 6y = 0 is: r2 − r − 6 = 0. Solve r2 − r − 6 = 0, then r1 = 3, and r2 = −2. Let y(x) = Ae2x be a particular solution to y′′ − y′ − 6y = e2x, then y′(x) = 2Ae 2x, and y′′(x) = 4Ae 2x. So we have 4Ae 2x − 2Ae2x − 6Ae 2x = e 2x. That is, −4Ae 2x = e 2x. 3 So A = − 1 4 . Therefore, a particular solution of y′′ − y′ − 6y = e2x is: y(x) = − e2x 4 . 6. 2.5.3: Find a particular solution of y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = e2x. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = 0 is: r2 − 4r + 4 = 0. Solve r2 − 4r + 4 = 0, then r1 = r2 = 2. Let y(x) = Ax2e2x be a particular solution to y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = e2x, then y′(x) = 2Axe2x + 2Ax2e2x, and y′′(x) = 2Ae 2x + 4Axe2x + 4Axe2x + 4Ax2e2x. So we have 2Ae2x + 4Axe2x + 4Axe2x + 4Ax2e2x − 4 [2Axe2x + 2Ax2e2x] + 4Ax 2e2x = e 2x. That is, 2Ae 2x = e 2x. So A = 1 2 . Therefore, a particular solution of y′′ − 4y′ + 4 = e2x is: y(x) = x2e2x 2 . 7. Let k be a real constant. Find a particular solution to y′′ + 4y = sin kt. (Hint: You should consider two cases k = 2 or k ̸= 2.) Answer. The characteristic equation to y′′ + 4y = 0 is r2 + 4 = 0. Hence r = ±2i. The general solution is yc(t) = c1 cos 2t + c2 sin 2t. For force f = sin kt, the ﬁrst guess of a particular solution is yp(t) = a cos kt + b sin kt. (2) 4 Case 1. k ̸= 2. The terms of yp do not overlap those of yc. Hence the guess (3) is good. We have y′ p(t) = −ak sin kt + bk cos kt, y′′ p (t) = −ak2 cos kt − bk2 sin kt. Lyp = y′′ p + 4yp = a(4 − k2) cos kt + (4 − bk2) sin kt. Comparing coeﬃcients, we have a(4 − k2) = 0, b(4 − k2) = 1. Hence a = 0 b = 1 4−k2 , and yp(t) = 1 4 − k2 sin kt . Case 2. k = 2. The terms of yp overlap those of yc. Hence the guess (3) is bad since Lyp = 0. We revise it by multiplying it by t: yp(t) = at cos 2t + bt sin 2t. We have y′ p(t) = (−2at + b) sin 2t + (2bt + a) cos 2t, y′′ p (t) = (−4at + 2b + 2b) cos 2t + (−4bt − 2a − 2a) sin 2t. Lyp = y′′ p + 4yp = 4b cos 2t − 4a sin 2t. Comparing coeﬃcients, we have 4b = 0 and −4a = 1. Hence yp(t) = − 1 4 t cos 2t . 8. Let k be a real constant. Find the form of a particular solution to Ly = y′′ +4y′ +5y = e−kt sin t. You do not need to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients. (Hint: You should consider two cases k = 2 or k ̸= 2.) Answer. The characteristic equation to Ly = 0 is r2 + 4r + 5 = 0. Completing square, (r + 2)2 = −1, hence r1, r2 = −2 ± i. The general solution is yc(t) = c1e −2t cos t + c2e −2t sin t. For force f = e−kt sin t, the ﬁrst guess of a particular solution is yp(t) = ae−kt cos t + be −kt sin t. (3) Case 1. k ̸= 2. The terms of yp do not overlap those of yc. Hence the guess (3) is good. Case 2. k = 2. The terms of yp overlap those of yc. Hence the guess (3) is bad since Lyp = 0. We revise it by multiplying it by t: yp(t) = ate−kt cos t + bte−kt sin t. 5","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
