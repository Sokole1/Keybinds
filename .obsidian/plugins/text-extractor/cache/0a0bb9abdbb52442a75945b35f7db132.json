The n players are assigned slots numbered from 1 to n. In the first round, the player in slot 1 plays the player in slot 2, the player in slot 3 plays the player in slot 4, etc. The winner of the players in slots 1 and 2 will be assigned slot 1 for the next round, the winner of the players in slots 3 and 4 will be assigned slot 2 for the next round, ete. This is illustrated below: the players are named A through H, and the subscript represents the slot number for each round of the competition round 1 A: B C: Dy E; Fs G Hs round 2 B C: E: H. round 3 C: H. H The organizers of the World Only-Relate championship want to make their tournament as exciting as possible and so are looking for a way to pair the contestants up to minimize the total “boredom” of the games of the tournament. They decide to caleulate “boredom” as follows: o They give each of players py, py. ... pn a ranking r(p;) that denotes how good player p; is: 7(p;) > r(p;) if player p; is better than player p;. o Every time a player p; plays against a player pj, the game generates a boredom equal to the difference between the players’ rankings: [r(p;) — 7(pj)|. ® The total boredom is the sum of the boredoms of the individual games. 1. |6 marks| Design a greedy algorithm that takes in a list of n players with their rankings, and assigns aslot to teach player so as minimize the sum of the boredom of the games of the tournament, assuming that whenever two players play each other, the best of the two always wins. Assume that n is a power of two. You do not need to prove the correctness of your algorithm formally, but you must state briefly (one sentence or two) why you believe it will minimize the sum of the boredom of the games of the tournament,.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
