(a) Suppose a parametrized curve ⃗r(t) in R2 is deﬁned on 0 ≤ t < ∞ and has velocity ⃗v = (t cos t, t sin t). Compute the normal vector ˆN(t). Answer: ˆN = (− sin t, cos t) Solution: Since ˆT = v/|v| and |v| = |t| = t ≥ 0, we have ˆT = (cos t, sin t). We compute d dt ˆT = (− sin t, cos t). Since this is a unit vector, we have ˆN = (− sin t, cos t). (b) Suppose a parametrized curve ⃗r(t) in R2 has constant speed |⃗v|(t) = 3 and moves along a circle of radius 2. Compute the norm of the acceler- ation |⃗a|. Answer: 9/2 Solution: The formula for the acceleration is ⃗a = ( d dt |v|) ˆT + (κ|v| 2) ˆN. The curvature of a circle of radius 2 is 1/2. Therefore ⃗a = (1/2)(3) 2 ˆN, and the norm of this vector is 9/2. Page 3 of 10 2. 6 marks Please place your answers in the boxes provided. (a) Consider the conservative vector ﬁeld on R 3 given by ⃗F = (x, y, z). A potential is e.g. ϕ = (1/2)(x2 + y2 + z2). Compute ∫ C ⃗F · dr where C is the curve given by ⃗r(t) = (sin t cos 2 t, t, cos t) from t = 0 to t = 2π. Answer: 2π2 Solution: By inspection, ⃗F = ∇ϕ with potential ϕ = (1/2)(x2 + y2 + z2), since ∂xϕ = x, ∂yϕ = y and ∂zϕ = z. The curve starts at (0, 0, 1) and ends at (0, 2π, 1). By the fundamental theorem of line integrals, ∫ C ⃗F · dr = ϕ(0, 2π, 1) − ϕ(0, 0, 1). This gives (1/2)(0 + (2π) 2 + 12) − (1/2)(0 + 0 + 1) which is 2π2. (b) Let ϕ be a function on R 3 such that ϕ(0, 0, 0) = 3, ∇ϕ(0, 0, 0) = (1, 2, 3). Let ⃗r(t) be a parametrized curve in R3 such that ⃗r(0) = (0, 0, 0), d dt⃗r(0) = (−1, 1, 1). Compute d dt ϕ(⃗r(t)) at t = 0. Answer: 4 Solution: By the chain rule d dtϕ(⃗r(t)) = ∇ϕ(⃗r(t)) · ⃗r ′(t). The answer is then (1, 2, 3) · (−1, 1, 1) = −1 + 2 + 3 = 4. Page 4 of 10 3. 10 marks Let ⃗r(t) = (t 2, 2t, t 3 3 ) , 0 ≤ t < ∞. (a) Compute the arclength function s(t) starting from t = 0. Solution: First we compute the velocity ⃗v(t) = (2t, 2, t 2), |⃗v| = √4t2 + 4 + t4 = ((t 2 + 2)2) 1/2 = t 2 + 2. The arclength function is s(t) = ∫ t 0 |⃗v| = ∫ t 0 (u 2 + 2)du = \f \f \f \f t 0 u3 3 + 2u = t 3 3 + 2t. (b) Compute the curvature κ(t). Solution: The acceleration is ⃗a = (2, 0, 2t). Taking the cross-product gives ⃗v × ⃗a =   i j k 2t 2 t2 2 0 2t   = (4t, −(4t 2 − 2t2), −4). Therefore |⃗v × ⃗a| 2 = 16t2 + 4t 4 + 16. The curvature is κ = |⃗v × ⃗a| |v|3 = (16t 2 + 4t 4 + 16)1/2(t 2 + 2)−3 which simpliﬁes to 2(4t 2 + t 4 + 4)1/2(t 2 + 2)−3 = 2(t 2 + 2)(t 2 + 2)−3 = 2(t2 + 2)−2. Page 5 of 10 4. 10 marks Let ⃗F = ( x (x2 + y2)1/2 , y (x2 + y2)1/2 ) be the vector ﬁeld deﬁned on the domain R 2\\{(0, 0)}. (a) Compute ∫ C ⃗F·dr, where C is the unit circle traveling counter-clockwise. Solution: We will show below that ⃗F is conservative. Therefore ev- ery loop integral is zero by the fundamental theorem of line integrals. So ∫ C ⃗F · dr = 0. (b) Is ⃗F conservative? If ⃗F is conservative, ﬁnd a potential. If ⃗F is not conservative, explain why not. Solution: This vector is indeed conservative. We search for poten- tial. To solve ∇ϕ = ⃗F, we ﬁrst let ∂xϕ = x (x2 + y2)1/2 , and ﬁnd ϕ(x, y) = (x2 + y2)1/2 + f (y). Next, y (x2 + y2)1/2 = ∂yϕ = ∂y [(x2 + y2)1/2 + f (y) ] = y (x2 + y2)1/2 + f ′(y). Therefore f ′(y) = 0 solves the system, potentials are of the form ϕ(x, y) = (x2 + y2) 1/2 + C, where C is an arbitrary constant. Page 6 of 10 5. 10 marks Let C be the curve from (1, 0) to (−1, 0) running counter-clockwise along the unit circle. Let ⃗F = (y3 + 1, −x3 + 2). Compute ∫ C ⃗F · dr. Solution: We start by computing 2D curlF = ∂x(−x3 + 2) − ∂y(y3 + 1) = −3(x2 + y2). By Green’s theorem ∫ C F · dr + ∫ L F · dr = ∫ ∫ R(−3)(x2 + y2)dA where R is the upper half-disc and L is the straight line from (−1, 0) to (1, 0). We compute ∫ ∫ R(−3)(x2 + y2)dA = −3 ∫ π 0 ∫ 1 0 r2rdrdθ = −3π ∫ 1 0 r3dr = −3 4π. To compute the line integral over L, we parametrize r(t) = (−1, 0) + t(2, 0), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, so that x(t) = −1 + 2t, y(t) = 0. The straight-line integral is then ∫ L F · dr = ∫ 1 0 (0 3 + 1, −(−1 + 2t) 3 + 2) · (2, 0)dt = 2 ∫ 1 0 dt = 2. The answer is ∫ C F · dr = − ∫ L F · dr + ∫ ∫ R(−3)(x2 + y2)dA = −2 − 3 4 π.
