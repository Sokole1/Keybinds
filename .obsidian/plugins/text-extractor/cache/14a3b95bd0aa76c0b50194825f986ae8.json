(c) Why does a large sparse matrix that is represented using MAT- LABâ€™s sparse matrix features consume less memory than the stor- age it takes to store the same matrix in the dense format? (d) When we solve a linear system Az = b, in what way is x = A\\b in MATLAB different than x = inv(A) x b? (e) Suppose A is a rectangular full-rank matrix of size m-by-n, where m > n, and b is an m-long vector. What does the command x = A\\b in MATLAB compute?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
