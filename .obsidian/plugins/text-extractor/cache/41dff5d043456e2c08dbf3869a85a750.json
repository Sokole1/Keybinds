Schiebinger Please explain your solutions, and show all work and calculations. You need not simplify calcu- lations. Calculators or other aids are not permitted. There are 5 questions worth a total of 38 marks. There are two pages (front and back). 1. The last three digits of a telephone number have been erased and all that we know is that the number was 604-822-3???. Assuming that all possibilities are equally likely, ﬁnd the probabilities of the events listed in parts (a)-(e). (a) (1 mark) The missing digits are 781 (in that order). (b) (1 mark) The set of missing digits is {1, 7, 8}. (c) (2 marks) The missing digits are all equal to each other. (d) (2 marks) Two of the missing digits are equal to each other, but the third is diﬀerent from the other two. (e) (2 marks) All three digits are diﬀerent from each other. (f) (2 marks) Determine the expected number of distinct missing digits. 2. The annual rainfall is a normal random variable with mean µ = 1000 mm and standard deviation σ = 100 mm. Assume that the rainfall in diﬀerent years is independent. (a) (2 marks) Find the probability that there is more than 1250 of rain in a year. (b) (2 marks) Among years with rainfall over 1100 mm, what proportion have rainfall exceeding 1250 mm? (c) (2 marks) Let X be the ﬁrst year (starting on January 1 of year 1) that the rainfall exceeds 1250 mm. What is the distribution of X (name and any parameters)? (d) (2 marks) Let Y be the number of years that the rainfall exceeds 1250 mm, out of the ﬁrst ten years. What is the distribution of Y (name and any parameters)? (e) (2 marks) For Y as in part (d), what is the expectation of Y 2? 3. (4 marks) A true-false question is posed to a team of people. Each team member independently gives the correct answer with probability p. The team members then vote on the answer to give as a team. Suppose the team has 3 members. What is the probability that the team settles on the right answer? 4. (4 marks) Smith owns two coins. One is fair, but the other lands on heads 3/4 of the time. They both look and feel identical, so the only way he can tell them apart is by ﬂipping them enough to observe the patterns in their behavior. Suppose he takes a coin at random (equally likely to be fair or biased), ﬂips it 20 times, and gets 12 heads. What is the probability that the coin is the fair one? 5. (a) Sara and Tara agree to meet for lunch. Sara arrives at a time S distributed uniformly over the hour between 12:00 and 13:00. Tara arrives independently at a time T with the same uniform distribution. We consider 12:00 as time zero and measure time in minutes. (b) (2 marks) What is the joint probability density of S, T ? (c) (2 marks) Write an inequality expressing the event that Sara must wait more than 10 minutes for Tara? (d) (6 marks) What is the probability that Sara must wait more than 10 minutes for Tara? 1 Table 1: Common Distributions Distribution Mean Variance Characteristic function Binomial (n, p) np np(1 − p) (1 − p + peit) n Geometric (p) 1/p 1 − p p2 peit 1 − (1 − p)eit Poisson (λ) λ λ eλ(eit−1) Uniform (a, b) a + b 2 (b − a)2 12 eita − eitb it(b − a) Exponential (λ) 1/λ 1/λ2 λ λ − it Normal (µ, σ2) µ σ2 eiµt−σ2t 2/2 Table 2: Cumulative distribution function Φ(x) of standard Normal distribution x 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.0 0.5000 0.5040 0.5080 0.5120 0.5160 0.5199 0.5239 0.5279 0.5319 0.5359 0.1 0.5398 0.5438 0.5478 0.5517 0.5557 0.5596 0.5636 0.5675 0.5714 0.5753 0.2 0.5793 0.5832 0.5871 0.5910 0.5948 0.5987 0.6026 0.6064 0.6103 0.6141 0.3 0.6179 0.6217 0.6255 0.6293 0.6331 0.6368 0.6406 0.6443 0.6480 0.6517 0.4 0.6554 0.6591 0.6628 0.6664 0.6700 0.6736 0.6772 0.6808 0.6844 0.6879 0.5 0.6915 0.6950 0.6985 0.7019 0.7054 0.7088 0.7123 0.7157 0.7190 0.7224 0.6 0.7257 0.7291 0.7324 0.7357 0.7389 0.7422 0.7454 0.7486 0.7517 0.7549 0.7 0.7580 0.7611 0.7642 0.7673 0.7704 0.7734 0.7764 0.7794 0.7823 0.7852 0.8 0.7881 0.7910 0.7939 0.7967 0.7995 0.8023 0.8051 0.8078 0.8106 0.8133 0.9 0.8159 0.8186 0.8212 0.8238 0.8264 0.8289 0.8315 0.8340 0.8365 0.8389 1.0 0.8413 0.8438 0.8461 0.8485 0.8508 0.8531 0.8554 0.8577 0.8599 0.8621 1.1 0.8643 0.8665 0.8686 0.8708 0.8729 0.8749 0.8770 0.8790 0.8810 0.8830 1.2 0.8849 0.8869 0.8888 0.8907 0.8925 0.8944 0.8962 0.8980 0.8997 0.9015 1.3 0.9032 0.9049 0.9066 0.9082 0.9099 0.9115 0.9131 0.9147 0.9162 0.9177 1.4 0.9192 0.9207 0.9222 0.9236 0.9251 0.9265 0.9279 0.9292 0.9306 0.9319 1.5 0.9332 0.9345 0.9357 0.9370 0.9382 0.9394 0.9406 0.9418 0.9429 0.9441 1.6 0.9452 0.9463 0.9474 0.9484 0.9495 0.9505 0.9515 0.9525 0.9535 0.9545 1.7 0.9554 0.9564 0.9573 0.9582 0.9591 0.9599 0.9608 0.9616 0.9625 0.9633 1.8 0.9641 0.9649 0.9656 0.9664 0.9671 0.9678 0.9686 0.9693 0.9699 0.9706 1.9 0.9713 0.9719 0.9726 0.9732 0.9738 0.9744 0.9750 0.9756 0.9761 0.9767 2.0 0.9772 0.9778 0.9783 0.9788 0.9793 0.9798 0.9803 0.9808 0.9812 0.9817 2.1 0.9821 0.9826 0.9830 0.9834 0.9838 0.9842 0.9846 0.9850 0.9854 0.9857 2.2 0.9861 0.9864 0.9868 0.9871 0.9875 0.9878 0.9881 0.9884 0.9887 0.9890 2.3 0.9893 0.9896 0.9898 0.9901 0.9904 0.9906 0.9909 0.9911 0.9913 0.9916 2.4 0.9918 0.9920 0.9922 0.9925 0.9927 0.9929 0.9931 0.9932 0.9934 0.9936 2.5 0.9938 0.9940 0.9941 0.9943 0.9945 0.9946 0.9948 0.9949 0.9951 0.9952 2.6 0.9953 0.9955 0.9956 0.9957 0.9959 0.9960 0.9961 0.9962 0.9963 0.9964 2.7 0.9965 0.9966 0.9967 0.9968 0.9969 0.9970 0.9971 0.9972 0.9973 0.9974 2.8 0.9974 0.9975 0.9976 0.9977 0.9977 0.9978 0.9979 0.9979 0.9980 0.9981 2.9 0.9981 0.9982 0.9982 0.9983 0.9984 0.9984 0.9985 0.9985 0.9986 0.9986 3.0 0.9987 0.9987 0.9987 0.9988 0.9988 0.9989 0.9989 0.9989 0.9990 0.9990 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
