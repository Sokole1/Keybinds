This is a contraction by the factor p. So |21 — @] < plag — 2*| < pPlar—1 —2\"| < - < Pz — 27 Since p < 1, we have p¥ — 0 as k — oo. This establishes convergence of the fixed-point iteration. To answer the fourth question on the facing page about the speed of convergence, it should be clear that the smaller p is, the faster the iteration converges. In fact, if p > 0 and it does not depend on the iteration counter k, then the convergence order is linear as discussed in the previous section. We saw in Section 2.2 for the bisection method (which is not a fixed-point iteration) that the speed of convergence does not depend on the given function and it is in fact identical to the speed of convergence obtained with p = 1/2. In contrast, for the fixed-point iteration, there is dependence on |g’(z)|. This, and the (negative) answer to our fifth and last question on the preceding page, are demonstrated in the two upcoming examples.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
