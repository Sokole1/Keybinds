November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 2 of 6 1. Use the method of undetermined coeﬃcients to ﬁnd a particular solution to: (a)(4 points) y′′ − 4y = ex. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − 4y = ex is r2 − 4 = 0, then r1 = 2 and r2 = −2. Let yp(x) = Aex be a particular solution to y′′ − 4y = ex, then y′ p(x) = Ae x, and y′′ p (x) = Aex. Then we have y′′ p − 4yp = Ae x − 4Aex = −3Aex = ex So we have A = − 1 3 . Then we have yp(x) = − 1 3 ex. (b)(4 points) y′′ − 4y = sin(2x). Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − 4y = sin(2x) is r2 − 4 = 0, then r1 = 2 and r2 = −2. Let yp(x) = A cos(2x) + B sin(2x) be a particular solution to y′′ − 4y = sin(2x), then y′ p(x) = −2A sin(2x) + 2B cos(2x), and y′′ p (x) = −4A cos(2x) − 4B sin(2x). Then we have y′′ p − 4yp = −4A cos(2x) − 4B sin(2x) − 4A cos(2x) − 4B sin(2x) = −8A cos(2x) − 8B sin(2x) = sin(2x). So we have A = 0 and B = − 1 8 . Then we have yp(x) = − 1 8 sin(2x). (c)(4 points) y′′ − 4y = e2x. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − 4y = sin(2x) is r2 − 4 = 0, then r1 = 2 and r2 = −2. Let yp(x) = Axe2x be a particular solution to y′′ − 4y = e2x, then y′ p(x) = Ae 2x + 2Axe2x, and y′′ p (x) = 2Ae 2x + 2Ae 2x + 4Axe2x = 4Ae 2x + 4Axe2x. Then we have y′′ p − 4yp = 4Ae2x + 4Axe2x − 4Axe2x = 4Ae2x = e2x So we have A = 1 4 . Then we have yp(x) = 1 4 xe2x. November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 3 of 6 2.(7 points) Use the method of variation of parameters to ﬁnd a particular solution to problem: y′′ − y = 2e −x. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − y = 0 is r2 − 1 = 0, then r1 = 1 and r2 = −1. So the general solution to y′′ − y = 0 is yc(x) = C1ex + C2e−x. Now let yp(x) = u1(x)ex + u2(x)e−x be a particular solution to y′′ − y = 2e−x for some functions. By the method of variation of parameters, we have u ′ 1(x)ex + u ′ 2(x)e−x = 0 u ′ 1(x)ex − u ′ 2(x)e−x = 2e−x. So we get u ′ 1(x) = e−2x, and u ′ 2(x) = −1. So we can take u1(x) = ∫ e −2x dx = − 1 2 e−2x, and u2(x) = − ∫ 1 dx = −x. Hence we know that yp(x) = u1(x)ex + u2(x)e −x = − 1 2 e −2x · e x − xe−x = − 1 2 e−x − xe−x. November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 4 of 6 3.(10 points) Use the Laplace transform to solve the following initial value problem: y′′ + 2y′ + 5y = δ(t − 1), y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 2. Answer. Let Y (s) = L[y(t)](s), apply the Laplace transform on the both sides of y′′ + 2y′ + 5y = δ(t − 1), then L[y′′] + 2L[y′] + 5L[y] = L[δ(t − 1)]. By the transform of derivatives, since y(0) = 1 and y′(0) = 0, then L[y′′] = s 2L[y] − sy(0) − y′(0) = s 2Y (s) − s − 2, and L[y′] = sL[y] − y(0) = sY (s) − 1. By looking up the table, we know that L[δ(t − 1)] = e−s. So we get s2Y (s) − s − 2 + 2sY (s) − 2 + 5Y (s) = e −s. So we get Y (s) = s + 4 + e−s s2 + 2s + 5 = s + 4 s2 + 2s + 5 + e−s s2 + 2s + 5 . Notice that s2 + 2s + 5 = (s + 1)2 + 4, by the ﬁrst and second shifting properties, we have y(t) = L −1[Y (s)](t) = L −1 [ s + 1 + 3 (s + 1)2 + 4 ] (t) + L −1 [ e−s (s + 1)2 + 4 ] (t) = e −tL −1 [ s + 3 s2 + 4 ] (t) + u(t − 1)L −1 [ 1 (s + 1)2 + 4 ] (t − 1) = e −t [ L−1 [ s s2 + 4 ] (t) + L−1 [ 3 s2 + 4 ] (t) ] + u(t − 1)e−2(t−1) 1 2 sin(2(t − 1)) = e−t[cos(2t) + 3 2 sin(2t)] + 1 2 u(t − 1)e−(t−1) sin(2(t − 1)). November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 5 of 6 4. (a)(6 points) Let F (s) = 1 s + 1 · 1 (s + 1)2 + 4 . Find L−1[F (s)](t). Answer. By the ﬁrst shifting property, we know that L −1[F (s)](t) = e −tL −1 [ 1 s(s2 + 4) ] (t). By the partial fraction, we know that 1 s(s2 + 4) = A s + Bs + C s2 + 4 . So we get 1 = A(s 2 + 4) + s(Bs + C) = (A + B)s 2 + Cs + 4A. So we get A + B = 0, C = 0, 4A = 1. Then A = 1 4 , B = − 1 4 and C = 0. Hence we have 1 s(s2 + 4) = 1 4 · 1 s − 1 4 · s s2 + 4 . So we have L−1[F (s)](t) = e−t [ 1 4 − 1 4 cos(2t)] . (b)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of f (t) = { et, if 0 ≤ t < 2, 0, if t ≥ 2. . Answer. It’s easy to see that f (t) = et[u(t − 0) − u(t − 2)] = et − etu(t − 2). By the second shifting property, we have L[f (t)](s) = L[e t] − L[e tu(t − 2)] = 1 s − 1 − L[e t+2−2u(t − 2)] = 1 s − 1 − e−2sL[e t+2] = 1 s − 1 − e−2se2L[e t] = 1 s − 1 − e2−2s s − 1 .
