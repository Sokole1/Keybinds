Then, taking two random initial guesses, stacking them together as an n x 2 matrix V; and applying the power method with Vj being an initial guess gives us Vj, and then we can compute Rayleigh quotients to estimate eigenvalues. This is: @ a good idea that will give us the two dominant eigenpairs â€˜ @ a bad idea that will give us only the dominant eigenpair @ aso-so idea that will work only in very special situations related to the initial Vj @ a bad idea because it will only work in single precision @ a bad idea because this algorithm would never converge to more ! than one correct decimal digit Ascher & Greif (UBC Computer Science) A First Course in Numerical Methods CPSC 302, Fall 2023 29/33","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
