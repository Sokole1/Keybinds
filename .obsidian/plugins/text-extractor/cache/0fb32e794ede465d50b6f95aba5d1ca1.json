A stationary iterative scheme for solving a linear system Ax = b can be written in the form xk“:karM’lrk, k=0,1,... where ry, = b— Axj, is the residual at the kth iteration, and M is a ma- trix associated with a splitting of A. The iteration matrix associated with stationary schemes is given by T=I-M\"'A Consider the scheme Xg41 = Xk + T'k. (a) Write down the iteration matrix corresponding to this scheme. (b) Suppose A is symmetric positive definite with eigenvalues AL= A= 2 A >0 State a condition on the eigenvalues of A for the iterative scheme to converge to the solution for any initial guess. Simplify the condition as much as you can, to depend on a minimal number of eigenvalues.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
