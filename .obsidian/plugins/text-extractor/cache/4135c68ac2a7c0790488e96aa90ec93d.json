(1.1.4 revised) Solve dy dx = 1 x2 − 1 , for y(0) = 0. Find its maximal interval of existence. Answer. By partial fraction, 1 x2 − 1 = 1/2 x − 1 − 1/2 x + 1 . Thus y = ∫ ( 1/2 x − 1 − 1/2 x + 1 ) dx = 1 2 ln |x − 1| − 1 2 ln |x + 1| + c. Since our solution is for x near 0, we have y = 1 2 ln(1 − x) − 1 2 ln(x + 1) + c. Using y(0) = 0, we have 0 = 0 − 0 + c and hence c = 0. Thus y(x) = 1 2 ln(1 − x) − 1 2 ln(x + 1). It exists for 1 − x > 0 and x + 1 > 0, i.e., −1 < x < 1. 2. (1.1.102) Solve x′ = 1 x2 , x(1) = 1. Answer. Denote the independent variable by t. Method 1: Consider x2 · dx dt = 1. Then d dt ( [x(t)]3 3 ) = 1. We integrate to get [x(t)]3 3 = t + c, i.e., x(t) = [3(t + c)] 1/3. From x(1) = 1, we obtain c = − 2 3 . The solution is thus x(t) = [3(t − 2 3 )]1/3. 1 Method 2: By considering t as a function of x (inverse function) and integrating dt dx = x2, or using that the equation is separable, we have t = ∫ x 2dx = x3 3 + c. Using x(1) = 1, we have 1 = 1 3 + c and hence c = 2 3 . Thus x = [3(t − 2 3 )]1/3 3. (1.2.3) Sketch slope ﬁeld for y′ = y2. Answer. 4. (1.2.5) Is it possible to solve the equation y′ = y√ |x| for y(0) = 0? Is the solution unique? Justify. Answer. Note that f (x, y) = y√ |x| is deﬁned and continuous for (x, y) near (0, 0). Moreover, ∂f ∂y = √ |x| is also deﬁned and continuous for (x, y) near (0, 0). By Picard’s theorem, there is a solution near (0, 0) and it is unique. Remark. ∂f ∂x is not deﬁned at x = 0 but it does not matter. 5. (§1.2) Find at least two solutions y1(t) and y2(t) of y′(t) = 2y1/2, y(0) = 0, for t ≥ 0. Explain why the existence of two solutions of the given problem does not contradict the uniqueness part of Theorem 1.2.1. Answer. By inspection, y1(t) = 0 for all t is a solution. To ﬁnd a nonzero solution, consider the inverse function t = t(y), dt dy = 1 2y1/2 , t = ∫ dy 2y1/2 = y1/2 + c. 2 Setting c = 0, we have a second solution y2(t) = t2 for all t. Their existence does not contradict the uniqueness part of Theorem 1.2.1 because the function on the right side of the DE f (t, y) = 2y1/2 has fy = y−1/2 which is not bounded near (t, y) = (0, 0). 6. (1.3.3) Solve dx dt = (x2 − 1)t, for x(0) = 0. Answer. The equation is separable. Rewrite as dx x2 − 1 = tdt. Integrating and using Exercise 1.1.4, 1 2 ln |x − 1| − 1 2 ln |x + 1| = 1 2 t 2 + c. Since our solution is for x near 0, we have 1 2 ln(1 − x) − 1 2 ln(x + 1) = 1 2 t 2 + c. Using x(0) = 0, we have 0 − 0 = 0 + c and hence c = 0. Thus t 2 = ln(1 − x) − ln(x + 1) = ln 1 − x 1 + x , e t2 = 1 − x 1 + x , and hence x = 1 − et2 1 + et2 . 7. (1.3.4) Solve dx dt = x sin(t), for x(0) = 1. Answer. The equation is separable. Rewrite as dx x = sin(t)dt. Integrating, we get ln |x| = − cos(t) + c. Since our solution is for x near 1, we have ln x = − cos(t) + c. Using x(0) = 1, we have 0 = −1 + c and hence c = 1. Thus ln x = − cos(t) + 1, and x = e1−cos(t). 3 8. (1.4.8) Solve 1 x2 + 1 y′ + xy = 3 with y(0) = 0. The solution is expressed using a deﬁnite integral which cannot be evaluated. Answer. Rewrite the equation as y′ + x(x2 + 1)y = 3(x 2 + 1). Choose the integrating factor as r(x) = e∫ x(x2+1)dx = e x4 4 + x2 2 . Multiplying the equation by r(x), we obtain e x4 4 + x2 2 · y′ + e x4 4 + x2 2 · (x3 + x)y = e x4 4 + x2 2 · 3(x 2 + 1) ⇒ d dx [e x4 4 + x2 2 · y(x)] = e x4 4 + x2 2 · 3(x2 + 1). Integrating this equation from x0 = 0 to x and using y(0) = 0, we have e x4 4 + x2 2 · y(x) − e 0 · y(0) = 3 ∫ x 0 e s4 4 + s2 2 · (s2 + 1) ds ⇒ e x4 4 + x2 2 · y(x) = 3 ∫ x 0 e s4 4 + s2 2 · (s2 + 1) ds ⇒ y(x) = 3e − x4 4 − x2 2 ∫ x 0 e s4 4 + s2 2 · (s2 + 1) ds. Remark. We need to use a deﬁnite integral to express this solution, since an initial condition is imposed. 9. (1.4.102) Solve y′ + 2 sin(2x)y = 2 sin(2x), for y(π/2) = 3. Answer. We choose the integrating factor as r(x) = e∫ 2 sin(2x)dx = e− cos(2x). Multiplying the equation by this r(x), we obtain e − cos(2x)[y′(x) + 2 sin(2x)y(x)] = 2e− cos(2x) sin(2x) ⇒ d dx [e− cos(2x) · y(x)] = 2e − cos(2x) sin(2x). Integrating this equation from x0 = π/2 to x and using y(π/2) = 3, we have e − cos(2x) · y(x) − e − cos(π) · y(π/2) = ∫ x π/2 2e− cos(2s) sin(2s) ds ⇒ e − cos(2x) · y(x) − 3e = e− cos(2s)| x π/2 ⇒ y(x) = e cos(2x)[3e + e− cos(2x) − e] ⇒ y(x) = 2ecos(2x)+1 + 1. 4 10. (1.4.103) Suppose a water tank is being pumped out at 3 L/min. The water tank starts at 10 L of clean water. Water with toxic substance is ﬂowing into the tank at 2 L/min, with concentration 20 t g/L at time t. When the tank is half empty, how many grams of toxic substance are in the tank (assuming perfect mixing)? Answer. Let x(t) be the grams of toxic substance in the tank at time t. Note that the change of toxic substance during time interval [t, t + △t] for small △t is △x = (the toxic substance ﬂowing in) − (the toxic substance ﬂowing out) = 20t · 2 · △t − 3 · x(t) 10 − (3 − 2)t · △t. Thus, △x △t = 40t − 3 · x(t) 10 − t . Letting △t → 0, we obtain the diﬀerential equation: dx dt + 3 x 10 − t = 40t. Choose the integrating factor as r(t) = e ∫ 3 10−t dt = (10 − t) −3. Multiplying the equation by this r(t), we obtain (10 − t)−3 dx dt + 3(10 − t) −3 x 10 − t = 40t · (10 − t)−3 ⇒ d dt [(10 − t)−3 · x(t)] = 40t · (10 − t)−3. We integrate to get (10 − t) −3 · x(t) = ∫ 40t · (10 − t) −3 dt = 40 ∫ [ −1 (10 − t)2 + 10 (10 − t)3 ]dt, = 40[−(10 − t)−1 + 10 · 1 2 (10 − t) −2] + c. Thus, x(t) = −40[(10 − t) 2 − 5(10 − t)] + c(10 − t) 3. Since x(0) = 0, we have c = 2. It takes 5 minutes for the tank to be half empty. Therefore, x(5) = −40[(10 − 5) 2 − 5(10 − 5)] + 2(10 − 5) 3 = 250. So the answer is 250 grams. 5","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
