Circle the correct answer below (no need to provide a justification): (i) There is no numerical difficulty in this scenario and we can proceed to numerically solve the problem and obtain a unique solution x (ii) There exists a unique solution where the entry of x that corresponds to the zero element of R is zero and the remaining components of x can be computed using an upper triangular solver (iii) Due to the zero on the diagonal of R, the matrix R is singular and we cannot proceed to compute a unique solution (iv) In reality there cannot be a situation where there is a zero entry of R and the only reason this has happened to begin with is due to roundoff errors (v) None of the above answers are correct (e) Continuing with the same scenario as in part (d), namely that one of the diagonal entries of R is zero, circle the correct answer below (no need to provide a justification): (i) The smallest singular value of A in this case is 0 (ii) The smallest singular value of A in this case is 1 (iii) The smallest singular value of A in this case depends on the data, b (iv) The smallest singular value of A cannot be determined (v) None of the above answers are correct","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
