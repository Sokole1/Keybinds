November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 2 of 7 1. (a)(5 points) Find the general solution of the equation y′′ + 2y′ + y = 0. Solution: (b)(5 points) Use the method of undetermined coeﬃcients to ﬁnd a particular solution of the equation y′′ + 2y′ + y = 3e −t. Solution: November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 3 of 7 2. (Do NOT use Laplace transform. Minus additional 1 point for using it.) (a)(6 points) A spring is stretched 0.2 m by a force of 5 N. (1 N = 1 kg·m s2 .) A mass of 1 kg is hung from the spring and is also attached to a viscous damper that exerts a force of 18 N when the velocity of the mass is 3 m/s. If the mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 0.4 m/s, determine its position x(t) at any time t. Here x is the displacement from the equilibrium position measured positive downward. (Hint: The mass spring system has equation mx′′ + cx′ + kx = 0 where m is the mass attached to the spring, c is the damping coeﬃcient so that the damping force is −cx′, and k is the spring constant so that the force is −kx when the spring is stretched by x.)

Find the steady periodic part of the solution x(t) for large time. Solution: November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 5 of 7 3. (a)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of f (t), where f (t) = { t 0 ≤ t < 2 2 2 ≤ t. Solution: (b)(5 points) Calculate the inverse Laplace transform of F (s) = 1 s 1 s2 + 1 using the integral formula. Solution: November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 6 of 7 4. (a)(5 points) Express the inverse Laplace transform of X(s) = 1 s2((s + 1)2 + 4) using the convolution formula (do not evaluate the integral). Solution: (b)(5 points) Consider the diﬀerential equation x′′ + bx′ + cx = f (t), x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 0. For what nonzero values of b, c and what forcing term f is the inverse Laplace transform of X(s) from part a) a solution to the diﬀerential equation?
