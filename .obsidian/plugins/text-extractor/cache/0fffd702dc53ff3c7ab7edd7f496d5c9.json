However, please ensure that your handwriting is legible. Question 1 (submit) We consider the following problem: utt(x, t) + 2ut(x, t) = uxx(x, t) − 3ux(x, t), 0 < x < 1, t > 0 u(0, t) = 0, u(1, t) = 0, t > 0 u(x, 0) = −e 3x/2 sin(2πx), ut(x, 0) = 2e 3x/2 sin(πx), 0 < x < 1 (1) Using the separation of variables method, solve the problem (1). Question 2 (submit) 1. Transform the following IBVP to an equivalent IBVP but with homogeneous boundary conditions ut(x, t) = uxx(x, t) + xt, 0 < x < 1, t > 0, u(0, t) = 1 − t, u(1, t) = t 2, t > 0, u(x, 0) = x, 0 < x < 1 2. Transform the following IBVP to an equivalent IBVP but with homogeneous boundary conditions ut(x, t) = uxx(x, t) + xt, 0 < x < 1, t > 0 ux(0, t) = t, ux(1, t) = t 2, t > 0 u(x, 0) = x + 1, 0 < x < 1. Question 3 (submit) Solve the following IBVP using the eigenfunction expansion method: urr(r, θ) + r−1ur(r, θ) + r−2uθθ(r, t) = 4, 0 < r < 1, −π < θ < π, u(1, θ) = 2 cos θ − sin(2θ), −π < θ < π Problem (do not submit) Solve the following IBVP subject to periodic boundary conditions using the eigenfunc- tion expansion method: urr(r, θ) + r−1ur(r, θ) + r−2uθθ(r, θ) = 3r−1 + 3 cos θ − 2r−2 sin θ + (3r−1 − 4r−2) cos(2θ) 0 < r < 1, −π < θ < π u(1, θ) = 3 + 3 cos θ + 7 sin θ, −π < θ < π 1 Solution: We have λ0 = 0, Θ0(θ) = 1 λn = n 2, Θ1n(θ) = cos(nθ), Θ2n(θ) = sin(nθ), n = 1, 2, . . . so we expect a solution of the form u(r, θ) = c0(r) + ∞∑ n=1 [c1n(r)Θ1n(θ) + c2n(r)Θ2n(θ)] The standard procedure now yields the BVPs rc′′ 0(r) + c′ 0(r) = 3, 0 < r < 1 c0(1) = 3, c0(r), c ′ 0(r) bounded as r → 0+ r2c′′ 11(r) + rc′ 11(r) − c11(r) = 3r2, 0 < r < 1 c11(1) = 3, c11(r), c ′ 11(r) bounded as r → 0+ r2c′′ 12(r) + rc′ 12(r) − 4c12(r) = 3r − 4, 0 < r < 1, c12(1) = 0, c12(r), c ′ 12(r) bounded as r → 0+ r2c′′ 1n(r) + rc′ 1n(r) − n2c1n(r) = 0, 0 < r < 1 c1n(1) = 0, c1n(r), c ′ 1n(r) bounded as r → 0 + (n ̸= 1, 2) r2c′′ 21(r) + rc′ 21(r) − c21(r) = −2, 0 < r < 1 c21(1) = 7, c21(r), c ′ 21(r) bounded as r → 0+ r2c′′ 2n(r) + rc′ 2n(r) − n 2c2n(r) = 0, 0 < r < 1 c2n(1) = 0, c2n(r), c ′ 2n(r) bounded as r → 0 + (n ̸= 1) with solutions c0(r) = 3r, c11(r) = r2 + 2r, c21(r) = 5r + 2, c12(r) = 1 − r c1n(r) = 0 (n ̸= 1, 2), c2n(r) = 0 (n ̸= 1) Consequently, u(r, θ) = 3r + (r2 + 2r) cos θ + (1 − r) cos(2θ) + (5r + 2) sin θ. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
