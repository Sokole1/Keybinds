Maryam R.Aliabadi What Security Issues Have We Seen So far? • SMTP spoofing • False BGP routing advertisements • DNS hijacking • No privacy in Ethernet, WiFi, IP, UDP, TCP • IP (source) address spoofing • … 5CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Learning Goals: Basics and Encryption • Explain the principles of security: • Confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability • Evaluate the tradeoffs of providing security at different levels • Application, transport, network • Demonstrate familiarity with security terminology • Alice, Bob, Trudy, plain text, cipher text, etc. • Explain the role of encryption in confidentiality • Explain the basics of an encryption scheme 6CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Reading • Reading: 8.1, 8.2 7CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi 8CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Principles of Security • Confidentiality: only the sender and the intended receiver should “understand” message contents • sender encrypts message • receiver decrypts message • Authentication: the sender and receiver want to confirm each other’s identity • Message integrity: the sender and receiver want to ensure that the message is not altered (in transit, or afterwards) without detection • Access and availability: services must be accessible and available to users 9CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Privacy and Security • TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery of data • It does not provide security or privacy • Neither does UDP, for that matter • How can we secure data? 10CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Alternatives for Security • What level should be responsible for security? • Options: • A new network-layer protocol (IPsec) • A new transport-layer protocol (QUIC) • A new “pseudo-layer” between transport and application (SSL, TLS) • Responsibility of the application (SSH) 11CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi The Actors • Most network security literature uses these names: • Alice, Bob want to communicate “securely” • Trudy (intruder) is an adversary who “attacks” the communication between Alice and Bob 12 secure sender secure receiver channel data, control messages data data Alice Bob Trudy CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi The Actors – Alice and Bob “Alice” and “Bob” can be: • Real-life people that want to communicate • A browser and server for electronic transactions (e.g., web stores) • A bank client and online banking service • A DNS client and server • BGP routers exchanging routing table updates 13CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi The Actors – Trudy Threat model: What can “Trudy” do? • eavesdrop: sniff and record messages on the channel • actively insert messages in the connection • impersonation: can fake (spoof) an entity, e.g., by spoofing source address in packet (or any field) • hijacking: “take over” ongoing connection by removing sender or receiver, inserting themselves in place • denial of service: prevent service from being used by others (e.g., by overloading resources, dropping packets) 14CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Confidentiality • No one but the sender and the receiver should be able to interpret the content of the message • Thought experiment: Where in “real life” do we have or expect to have confidentiality? • Phone call? • Conversation while outside? • Conversation while inside our home? • Given that Trudy can see all the data, how do we provide confidentiality? 15CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Encryption: The Basics An encryption algorithm comprises: • A method for encrypting the data • A method for decrypting the data • A secret key used in the decryption/encryption method • May be a pair of keys – one for encryption, one for decryption 16CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Encryption: The Basics Example: Caesar cipher • Encryption: replace all letters by the corresponding letter 𝐾 positions ahead in the alphabet • Decryption: repeat process with (−𝐾) • Secret key is 𝐾 • Rot13 is the Caesar cipher with a key of 13 17CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Question Insert the following attendance code in the poll: 18 Section 2: https://join.iclicker.com/WJGW Section 1: https://join.iclicker.com/LDAS FARABI CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Question Using the Caesar cipher with K = 13 (also known as rot13) Decrypt the following message: GHEAVC 19 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |||||||||||||||||||||||||| NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Answer Using the Caesar cipher with K = 13 (also known as rot13) Decrypt the following message: GHEAVC TURNIP 20 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |||||||||||||||||||||||||| NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Encryption Approach • Naïve approach: security by obscurity • assume attacker is unaware of the decryption method • unsafe: good encryption algorithms are eventually made public • attackers can “pick a lock” • Better approach: secret key • assume attacker knows the method, but not the key • decryption is impossible without the key 21CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi The language of cryptography 22 𝑚: plaintext (a.k.a. clear text) message 𝐾𝐴 𝑚 : ciphertext, encrypted with key KA 𝐾𝐵 𝐾𝐴 𝑚 = 𝑚 plaintext plaintextciphertext 𝐾𝐴 encryption algorithm decryption algorithm Alice’s encryption key 𝐾𝐵 Bob’s decryption key CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction. Maryam R.Aliabadi Breaking an Encryption Scheme • Ciphertext-only attack: • Trudy has ciphertext, but not plaintext (e.g., knows 𝐾𝐴 𝑚 but not 𝑚) • Option 1: brute force, search through all keys • Option 2: statistical analysis (look for patterns) • Known-plaintext attack: • Trudy has some ciphertext with its plaintext (e.g., for some 𝑚 it knows 𝐾𝐴 𝑚 ), wants to break other ciphertexts • Chosen-plaintext attack: • Trudy has the ability to encrypt any plaintext (e.g., knows 𝐾𝐴, or can trick Alice into encrypting any message), but doesn’t have key for decryption 23CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Introduction.
