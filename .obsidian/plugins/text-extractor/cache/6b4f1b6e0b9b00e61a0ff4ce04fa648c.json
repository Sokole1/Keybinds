(a) True (b) False (c) True (d) True (e) False (if P = P T and P = P 2 as given in the question, then P T P = P 2 = P ̸= I; this is a small variation of practice question 5(d)) (f) False (u T (I − 2uu T )u = −u T u = 1 < 0; this is a tiny variant of practice question 5(b))) 2. (a) ‹ Stage 1: form P A = LU once ‹ Stage 2: for i = 1, . . . , m: Solve Ly(i) = P b (i), followed by U xi) = y(i) (b) ‹ Stage 1: O(n3) (computation of the LU decomposition, once). ‹ Stage 2: O(mn2) (permutations, forward and backward substitutions, m times each). Note that the permutations do not change the leading order of the number of operations. In the decomposition stage, we may consider the cost as O(n 2) if done by physically swapping the entries of the rows, but this is part of an O(n3) computation. If we store the matrix P as a vector and swap indices, then during the m steps of backward and forward substitutions the permutation of the entries of the right-hand side vectors b (i) will take O(n) operations. 3. (a) Show it for the 9 × 9 example, and this straightforwardly generalizes to n × n digaonal blocks that are each lower triangular A =               × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × × × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × × × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × × 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 × × ×  | | | | | | | | | | | |  . (b) The overall computational cost is O(n4) ﬂoating point operations, because we have n blocks of size n × n each, and for each of them we perform O(n3) ﬂoating point operations. Note that Cholesky takes O(n 3) ﬂoating point operations; it is cheaper than standard LU by a factor of a half, not by an order of magnitude. 4. (a) The correct answer is (i) (since ∥Q∥ = 1, it follows that ∥A∥ = ∥R∥ and similarly for the inverses) (b) The correct answer is (i) (Q T Q = I and all eigenvlaues of I are one) (c) We need to solve Rx = c, where c is the upper n-component part of Q T b. Since R is upper triangular, the computational cost is O(n2). (d) The correct answer is (iii). The matrix R is singular because it is upper triangular and it has a zero on its diagonal. Therefore, there is no unique solution to the linear system Rx = c which we need to solve. (e) The correct answer is (ii). Since R is singular, the matrix A is not full rank, or if it’s easier to see it, the matrix AT A = RT R is also singular. Therefore A has a zero singular value, or if it’s easier to see this, we have that AT A has a zero eigenvalue.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
