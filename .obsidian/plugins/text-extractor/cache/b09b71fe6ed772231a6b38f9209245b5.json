Use the method of separation of variables to solve the problem. Answer: Assume solution is of the form 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) . Differentiate both sides: 𝑢 𝑡 = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) Then substituting into the original to get: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 4 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) Dividing by 4 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) : 4 ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 for some constant 𝜆 since both sides depend on different variables, they must equal a constant. Solve for time : 4 ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜆 ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜆4 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) . Solving gives: 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑒 𝜆4 𝑡 for some constant 𝐶 Solve space equation : 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) . Now analyze the cases of 𝜆 Case 1. 𝜆 = 0 . This simplifies the equation to: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑥 + 𝐵 . Applying the boundary conditions: 𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so 𝐵 = 0 𝑢 ( 2 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 2 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 2 𝐴 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so 𝐴 = 0 This gives a trivial solution. Case 2. 𝜆 > 0 . Let 𝜆 = 𝜇 2 so: 𝑋 ″ − 𝜇 2 𝑋 = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑒 𝜇 𝑥 + 𝐵 𝑒 − 𝜇 𝑥 Now we apply the boundary condition:𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ ( 𝐴 + 𝐵 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 = − 𝐵 𝑢 ( 2 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 2 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ ( − 𝐵 𝑒 2 𝜇 + 𝐵 𝑒 − 2 𝜇 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 Here we need 𝐵 ( 𝑒 − 2 𝜇 + 𝑒 2 𝜇 ) = 0 but since 𝜇 > 0 this is only the case when 𝐵 = 0 so 𝐴 = 0 and we have another trivial solution. 1 William Kang Mathematics 257/316 Homework 6 77253938 Case 3. 𝜆 < 0 . Let 𝜆 = − 𝜇 2 so: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) + 𝜇 2 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) + 𝐵 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) Now we apply the boundary condition:𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 = 0 𝑢 ( 2 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 sin ( 2 𝜇 ) = 0 . We want a non-trivial solution so 𝐴 ≠ 0 . So we need sin ( 2 𝜇 ) = 0 . This is true when 2 𝜇 = 𝑛 𝜋 , 𝑛 = 1 , 2 , 3 , … So 𝑢 𝑛 = 𝑛 𝜋 2 , 𝜆 𝑛 = − ( 𝑛 𝜋 2 ) 2 Therefore 𝑋 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑎 𝑛 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 2 𝑥 ) . Combining with 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑒 𝜆4 𝑡 we have: 𝑢 𝑛 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑏 𝑛 𝑒 − 14 ( 𝑛 𝜋 2 ) 2 𝑡 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 2 𝑥 ) , 𝑛 = 1 , 2 , 3 , … (1) General solution is: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 𝑏 𝑛 𝑒 − 𝑛 2 𝜋 2 1 6 𝑡 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 2 𝑥 ) (2) Find the coefficients 𝑏 𝑛 with the initial condition: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 2 sin ( 𝜋 𝑥 2 ) − sin ( 𝜋 𝑥 ) + 4 sin ( 2 𝜋 𝑥 ) , 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 2 2 sin ( 𝜋 𝑥 2 ) − sin ( 𝜋 𝑥 ) + 4 sin ( 2 𝜋 𝑥 ) = 𝑏 1 sin ( 𝜋2 𝑥 ) + 𝑏 2 sin ( 𝜋 𝑥 ) + 𝑏 3 ( sin ( 3 𝜋 2 𝑥 ) ) + 𝑏 4 sin ( 2 𝜋 𝑥 ) + … Matching coefficients we must have 𝑏 1 = 2 , 𝑏 2 = − 1 , 𝑏 3 = 0 , 𝑏 4 = 4 then all subsequent equal 0. So: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 2 𝑒 − 𝜋 2 1 6 𝑡 sin ( 𝜋2 𝑥 ) − 𝑒 − 𝜋 2 4 𝑡 sin ( 𝜋 𝑥 ) + 4 𝑒 − 𝜋 2 𝑡 sin ( 2 𝜋 𝑥 ) 2 William Kang Mathematics 257/316 Homework 6 77253938 Question 2We consider the problem of heat diffusion in a metal rod of length 𝐿 = 1 . 𝜕 𝑢 𝜕 𝑡 − 𝜕 𝑢 2 𝜕 𝑥 2 = 0 , for 0 < 𝑥 < 1 , and 𝑡 ≥ 0 𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 and 𝜕 𝑢 𝜕 𝑥 ( 1 , 𝑡 ) = 0 , for 𝑡 > 0 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑥 ( 1 − 𝑥 ) , for 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1 Determine the temperature 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) using the method of separation of variables. Answer: Assume solution is of the form 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) . Differentiate both sides: 𝑢 𝑡 = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) Then substituting into the original to get: 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 Dividing by 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) : ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 for some constant 𝜆 since both sides depend on different variables, they must equal a constant. Solve for time : ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜆 ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜆 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) . Solving gives: 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑒 𝜆 𝑡 for some constant 𝐶 Solve space equation : 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) . Now analyze the cases of 𝜆 Case 1. 𝜆 = 0 . This simplifies the equation to: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑥 + 𝐵 . 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 Applying the boundary conditions: 𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so 𝐵 = 0 𝑢 𝑥 ( 1 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ′ ( 1 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so 𝐴 = 0 This gives a trivial solution.

Case 3. 𝜆 < 0 . Let 𝜆 = − 𝜇 2 so: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) + 𝜇 2 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) + 𝐵 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝜇 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) − 𝐵 𝜇 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) Now we apply the boundary condition:𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 = 0 𝑢 𝑥 ( 1 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 𝜇 cos ( 𝜇 ) = 0 . We want a non-trivial solution so 𝐴 ≠ 0 . So we need cos ( 𝜇 ) = 0 . This is true when 𝜇 𝑛 = 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 , 𝑛 = 0 , 1 , 2 , … So 𝜆 𝑛 = − ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 ) 2 Therefore 𝑋 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑎 𝑛 sin ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 𝑥 ) . Combining with 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑒 𝜆 𝑡 we have: 𝑢 𝑛 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑏 𝑛 𝑒 − ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 ) 2 𝑡 sin ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 𝑥 ) , 𝑛 = 0 , 1 , 2 , … (3) General solution is: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞𝑛 = 0 𝑏 𝑛 𝑒 − ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 ) 2 𝑡 sin ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 𝑥 ) Find the coefficients 𝑏 𝑛 with the initial condition: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑥 ( 1 − 𝑥 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = ∑ ∞𝑛 = 0 𝑏 𝑛 sin ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 𝑥 ) We can use Parseval’s Identity: 𝑏 𝑛 = 2 ∫ 1 0 𝑥 ( 1 − 𝑥 ) sin ( 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 𝑛 2 𝑥 ) 𝑑 𝑥 4","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
