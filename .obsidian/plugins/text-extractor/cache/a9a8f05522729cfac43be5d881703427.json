The iterations converge in those two cases to M =0andtoz*® =1, respectively. A student has computed for 2y = 0.1 the values of el = |z — 2\"V = |ay — 0] = |z, and for 2o = 1.1 the values of e? = |y —2*®| = |z — 1. These errors for the initial guess and the first four iterations have been recorded in Tables 1 and 2 below, but there has been a mixup and the student does not remember which table represents the convergence to which root, because he/she forgot to write for each e, whether it is e;l) or c,(f).
