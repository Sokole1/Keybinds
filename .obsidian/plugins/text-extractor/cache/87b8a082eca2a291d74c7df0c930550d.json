Consider a closed loop electrical circuit formed of capacitor of capacitance C' and an inductor of inductance L placed in series. At ¢ = 0, the initial voltage of the inductor is Uy (0) = Uy, the initial voltage of the capacitor is Uc(0) = —Up and the initial current in the circuit is i(0) = 0. Give an expression of the time-evolution of the voltage of the capacitor Uc(t). No undetermined constant of integration should remain.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
