If pages are 4096 bytes, PTEs are 4 bytes, and each PTE requires five bits of metadata, what is the maximum number of physical pages that this machine can support? Assume that this architecture, unlike the x86, allows the page number to occupy bit positions in the PTE that overlap with offset bits in the address. (That is, you may assume no unused bits in the PTE.) 1024 o 134217728 Submitted ubmitted answer wkang01@ubc.ca submitted at 2024-04-12 19:49:39 (PDT) 1024 If the PTE is 4 bytes, then we have 32 bits in each PTE. We need five of them for metadata, which leaves us 27 for the physical page number. Therefore, we can represent 227 pages.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
