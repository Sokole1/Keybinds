Answer the following two questions about what this reduction establishes. [3 marks| Does this establish that MYSTERY is in NP? Circle one. YES NO Does this establish that MYSTERY is NP-complete? Circle one. YES NO 4. True or False. [4 marks] (a) An adversary can provide input that forces worst-case performance from Randomized QuickSort. TRUE FALSE (b) A reduction must work for any legal input to the original problem. TRUE FALSE (¢) NP-complete problems are the hardest kinds of algorithmic problems. TRUE FALSE (d) Assuming P # NP, the following subproblem of the Steiner Tree Problem is in P (i.e., can be solved in polynomial time): the subproblem containing only the instances where all nodes are shaded.
