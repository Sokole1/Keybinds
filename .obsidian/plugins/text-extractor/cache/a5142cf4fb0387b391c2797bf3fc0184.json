We write (2.1)\\’\\ d =ma + nb, ? where m and n are @3&&@ integers. We will show thatd | a and d | b. By the division algorithm, we have a=dg+r, 0<r<d From this equation and (2.1), we see that r=a—dq =a— q(ma+nb) = (1-gm)a — qnb . This shows that the integer r is a linear combination of @ and . Since 0 <r <d, and d is the least positive linear combination of a and b, we conclude that » = 0, and hence d | a. In a similar manner, we can show that d|b. We now demonstrate that d is the greatest common divisor of @ and b. To | show this, all we need to show is that any common divisor ¢ of @ and b must | divide d. Since d = ma + nb, if ¢ | a and ¢ | b, Proposition 1.4 tells us that cld. o We have shown that the greatest common divisor of the integers @ and b, that are not both zero, is a linear combination of @ and 4. How to find a particular linear combination of @ and b equal to (a, b) will be discussed in the next section. We can also define the greatest common divisor of more than two integers.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
