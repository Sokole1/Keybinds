Assume boundary conditions are C(0, t) = C(a, t) = 0, t > 0, and the initial concentration is given by C(x, 0) = f (x), 0 < x < a. (a) Use the method of separation of variables to solve for the concentration C(x, t). (b) What happens to the concentration as t → ∞? (c) What is the concentration C(x, t) if the initial condition is C(x, 0) = cos(πx/a)?

[Orthogonality] Show that the following functions are orthogonal on the prescribed intervals: (a) f1(x)= x and f2(x)= x2 on [−2, 2]. (b) The Legendre Polynomials P0(x)=1,P1(x)= x, P2(x)= 1 2 (3x2 − 1) on [−1, 1]. Use this orthogonality to expand f (x)= ½ −1 for − 1 <x< 0 1 for 0 <x< 1 as follows f (x)= a0P0(x)+ a1P1(x)+ a2P2(x). 2. [Periodic functions] Which of the following functions are periodic?

[Fourier series] Consider the function f (x)= ½ x2 for 0 <x< π 0 for π <x< 2π deﬁnedonthe interval 0 <x< 2π. (a) Sketch 3 periods of the periodic extension of f of period 2π. Determine the Fourier series representation of f. This series converges for all x. Indicate on your sketch the function to which the series converges? Use this series to show that: (i) π2 6 =1 + 1 22 + 1 32 + ... and (ii) π2 12 =1 − 1 22 + 1 32 − .. .. (b) Sketch the even and odd periodic extensions of f that are of period 4π.
