Only your ﬁnal answer is required here, and there will be no partial credit. (a) Suppose a particle r(t) travels at constant speed |v(t)| = 1 along a curve C with curvature κ(t) = 1 + t 2. Compute the norm of the acceleration |a| at t = 1. (b) True or False. Suppose F is a vector ﬁeld and C is a closed curve such that∫ C F · dr = 1. Then F cannot be a conservative vector ﬁeld. (c) Let r(t) be a parametrized curve with corresponding moving frame { ˆT, ˆN, ˆB}. Compute d ˆT dt × ˆN. (d) True or False. If C is a smooth simple closed curve lying in the region {(x, y) ∈ R2 such that x < 1 and (x, y) ̸= (0, 0)} then ∫ C − y x2 + y2 dx + x x2 + y2 dy = 0. 2. Consider the curve parametrized by r(t) = ⟨t + sin t, t − sin t, √ 2 cos t⟩, −∞ < t < ∞. Compute the curvature κ and the torsion τ of the curve at the point (0, 0, √2). 3. Let F be a vector ﬁeld on R 3 given by F = ⟨y2e x + ze x, 2ye x + z2, e x + 2yz⟩. (a) Find a potential of F or show that none exists. (b) Let Lλ be the straight line from (0, 0, 0) to (0, 1, −λ). Find the value of λ which minimizes the work f (λ) = ∫ Lλ F · dr. 4. Let C be the curve in R 2 consisting of 3 line segments from (1, 0) to (1, 1), from (1, 1) to (0, 2), and from (0, 2) to (0, 0). Compute the line integral ∫ C F · dr for the vector ﬁeld F(x, y) = ⟨−3xy + e x, sin y⟩. Page 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
