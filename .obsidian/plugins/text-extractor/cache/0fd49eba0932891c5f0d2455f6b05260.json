What are the requirements for e? Ans: We need e to be coprime to ϕ(n) = 10, 812. This means that we have to factor 10,812 to understand the requirements further. We obtain 10, 812 = (102)(106) = (2)(51)(2)(53) = (2)(3)(17)(2)(53) = 22(3)(17)(53) which means that the factorization of e must have no 2s, no 3s, no 17s, and no 53s. Furthermore, 2 < e < 10, 812. b) Suppose Bob chose e = 2141. What are the requirements for d? Ans: We require d = e−1 mod ϕ(n), which means d = (2141)−1 mod 10, 812. We need to compute the inverse of 2141 mod 10,812. A computer program (SAGE) tells us this is 101. c) Which of the six items among n, p, q, e, ϕ(n), d (notation as in class) will comprise Bob’s Public key? 2. What is the plaintext message that corresponds to the ciphertext 1213 0902 0539 1208 1234 1103 1374 that is produced using modular exponentiation with modulus p = 2591 and encryption key e = 13? Mention clearly what information is required to decode. That information is 797 and 0314 1314 1917 0400 0319 0708 1823. You are expected to know what 797 is and what the blocks of four digits are corresponding to the ciphertext. Write the decryption formula clearly. (3pts) Ans: An inverse for 13 modulo 2590 is 797. For each group in the ciphertext, the corresponding plaintext is decoded by P ≡ C797 mod 2591. 1 This gives us 0314 1314 1917 0400 0319 0708 1823. The corresponding text is DO NO TR EA DT HI SX. 3. What is the plain text message that corresponds to the ciphertext 01 09 00 12 12 09 24 10 that is produced using modular exponentiation with modulus p = 29 and encryption key e = 5? You are given that d = 17. Write down the encyrption and decryption formulae. The decrypted number blocks are 01 04 00 12 12 04 20 15. How do you interpret these numbers in terms of the cipher text? (5pts) 4. Show that the encryption and decryption procedures are identical when encryption is done using modular exponentiation with modulus p = 31 and encryption key e = 11. (3pts) Ans: The encrypting transformation is C ≡ P 11 mod 31. The deciphering exponent is the inverse of 11 modulo 30 as ϕ(31) = 30. But 11 is its own inverse modulo 30 as 112 = 121 and 121 is congruent to 1 modulo 30. Hence d = e = 11 and the decrypting transformation has the same exponent 11 as the encrypting transformation. 5. Find the primes p and q if n = pq = 14, 647 and ϕ(n) = 14, 400. (4pts) As ϕ(n) = (p − 1)(q − 1) = pq − (p + q) + 1, we have 14, 400 = 14, 647 − (p + q) + 1. So we get (p + q) = 248. Also, we have p − q = √ (p + q)2 − 4n = √ (248)2 − 4.14647 = √2916 = 54. We get (p + q) = 248 and (p − q) = 54. Simplifying, we get p = 151 and q = 97. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
