(a) The singular value decomposition (SVD) is expensive to compute in general, but suppose we happen to have computed it for some purpose for a square nonsymmetric nonsingular matrix A, and we are now in need of computing a solution of the linear system Ax = b. Suppose A is n x n. If A=UZVT is the SVD, write down the solution of the linear system in terms of U, X,V and b. (b) How many floating point operations would it take to compute the solution using the numerical procedure of (a)? (That is, assum- ing that the singular value decomposition of A is already given.)
