A particle of mass 1 g has a random velocity X that is uniformly distributed between 2 cm/s and 3 cm/s. (a) Find the cumulative distribution function of the particle’s kinetic energy T’ = %X 2, 1, 2<z<3 Answer: fx(z) = {0 othernie 0, z<2 Fx(z) =S 22, 2<e<3 1, 2>3 T =1X?so when z =2,t =2 whenz =3,t = Fp(t) = P(T < t) = P(1X? < t) = P(X < V2t) = Fx(V2t) 0, t<2 Fp(t) = < vai-2, 2<t<§ 1, >3 (b) Find the probability density function of T. 3 Answer: The p.d.f. is just derivative of the CDF. f(t) = %F(t) = {(2” 2, 2si<q 0, otherwise (c) Determine the mean and standard deviation of T' in two ways: (i) using the p.d.f. of T from part (b), (ii) using the Law of the Unconscious Statistician and the uniform density of X.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
