Recall that f € C* means that all derivatives of f up to order k exist and are continuous. (a) V x (fVf) =0 for all C? scalar function f in R®. (b) V- (fF) =Vf-F+ fV-F for all C\" scalar functions f and C* vector fields F in R®. (c) A smooth space curve C' with constant curvature £ = 0 must be a part of a straight line. (d) A smooth space curve C' with constant curvature & # 0 must be part of a circle of radius 1/k. (e) If f is any smooth function defined in R? and if C' is any circle, then JeVf-dr=0. (f) Suppose F is a smooth vector field in R* and V - F = 0 everywhere. Then, for every sphere, the flux out of one hemisphere is equal to the flux into the opposite hemisphere. (g) Let F(z,y,2) be a continuously differentiable vector field which is defined for every (2,9,2). Then, [V x F-iidS =0 for any closed surface S.
