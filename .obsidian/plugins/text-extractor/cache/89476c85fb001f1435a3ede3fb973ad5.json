Since F is C! on R?, we can also confirm this by checking that 0;F; = 0;F;. Next, observe that C is closed; (0,0,0) is both the initial and the terminal point. We know that the line integral of a conservative field along any closed curve is 0. Therefore, the integral is 0.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
