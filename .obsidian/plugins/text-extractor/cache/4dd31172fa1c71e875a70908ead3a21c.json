For a SAT instance I, a truth assignment is a potential solution, and the truth assignment is a good solution if it satisfies instance I. Suppose in addition to instance I you were given a truth assignment, say represented as an array T[1..n] where T'[4] is true if and only if z; is set to true. How long would it take to certify that a truth assignment is good? 3. A brute force algorithm could make a list of the variables z1,...,z, in the problem, try every assign- ment of truth values to these variables, and return YES if any satisfies the expression or NO otherwise. Asymptotically, how many truth assignments might this algorithm try (in terms of n)?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
