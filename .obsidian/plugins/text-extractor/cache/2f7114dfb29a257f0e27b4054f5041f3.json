My earler proof unnecessarily constrained the common divisor d or pinthe 0 €3 & last response) to be prime, which in't recuired. Let's go back and prove the statement without restricting ourselves to prime divisors. Given, 1 (a,b) =1 2. cl(a+b) We need to show: 1 (ca)=1 2 (e,b) =1 Prooffor (c,a) = 1: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, (c, @) # 1. Then, there exists an integer d > 1such that d|c and dfa. Fromc(a + b), talsofollows that d|(a + b) since de. But since d]a, it must then be the case that db (because d divides the sum a -+ band it divides ). However, this contradicts the given condition (a, b) = 1, which means a and b have no common divisor other than 1 Thus, our assumption that (¢, a) # 1 was incorrect, so (¢, a) = 1. Prooffor (c,b) = 1 Similarly, suppose (¢, b) # . Then, there exists aninteger d > 1 such that dc and d]b. Fromc](a + ), we have d|(a + b). But since db, it also means da (because d divides the suma + banditdivides b). This contradicts the contion (a, b) = 1. Thus, our assumption that (¢, b) # 1 was incorrect,so (¢, b) = 1. Inconclusion, i a, b, and c are integers such that (a, b) = 1 and c|(a + b),then (c,a) = 1 and (c,b) = 1.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
