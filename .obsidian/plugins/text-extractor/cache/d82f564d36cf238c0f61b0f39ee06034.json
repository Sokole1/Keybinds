Describe a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve this problem. Your algorithm should return such a position if it exists, or nil otherwise. If A[i] = i for several different integers i, then you may return any one of them. 2. Analyze the running time of your algorithm as a function of the number of elements of A.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
