November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 2 of 6 1. (a)(5 points) Find a particular solution to y′′ + 3y = 9x2 + 3x. (b)(5 points) Find the inverse Laplace transform f (t) of F (s) = 4 s(s2 + 4) . November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 3 of 6 2. (a)(5 points) Find a particular solution to y′′ + 2y′ + y = 2e−x using the method of undetermined coeﬃcients. (b)(5 points) Find a particular solution to the same equation y′′ + 2y′ + y = 2e−x, this time using the method of variation of parameters. November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 4 of 6 3. Suppose the displacement x(t) of a damped mass-spring system subject to sinusoidal forcing of amplitude F0 is modelled by: x′′ + 4x′ + 13x = F0 sin(t), x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 1. (a)(5 points) Find the solution x(t) when F0 = 0 (no forcing). (b)(5 points) Now take F0 = 40, and ﬁnd the steady periodic solution (the part of the solution x(t) which remains as t → ∞). Do not ﬁnd the transient part. November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 5 of 6 4. (a)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of the solution to the following initial value problem: x′′ − x′ + x = f (t), x(0) = 0, and x′(0) = 1, where f (t) = { 1, if 0 ≤ t < 1, t, if t ≥ 1. (b)(5 points) Solve the initial value problem: x′′ + x′ = δ(t − 1), x(0) = x′(0) = 0.
