Note: the notation “max f(z)” means “the value of f(z) where f(z) is maximized”, whereas “arg max f(z)” means “the value of z such that f(z) is maximized”. Likewise for min and argmin. For example, the min of the function f(z) = (z — 1)? is 0 because the smallest possible value is f(z) = 0, whereas the arg min is 1 because this smallest value occurs at = 1. The min is always a scalar but the arg min is a value of z, so it’s a vector if x is vector-valued.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
