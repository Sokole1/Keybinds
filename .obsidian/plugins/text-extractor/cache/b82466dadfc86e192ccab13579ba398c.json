Suppose a and b are both relatively prime to the positive integer n. If (ordn a, ordn b) = 1, show that ordn(ab) = ordn a · ordn b. 2. Let n be a positive integer and a an integer relatively prime to n. If ordn a = n − 1, show that n is prime. 3. a) Show that the integer 20 has no primitive roots. b) Find a primitive root modulo 14 and 18. c) Find a complete set of incongruent primitive roots of 17. 4. Show that if ¯a is an inverse of a modulo n, then ordn a = ordn ¯a. 5. Decide whether it is true that if n is a positive integer and d is a divisor of ϕ(n), then there is an integer a with ordn a = d. Give reasons for your answer. 6. Let m = an − 1, where a and n are positive integers. Show that ordm a = n, and conclude that n | ϕ(m). 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
