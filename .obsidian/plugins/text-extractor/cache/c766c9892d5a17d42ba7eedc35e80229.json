Thus, f; and f; have the same values, in exact arithmetic, for any given argument values o and h. (a) Derive fy(z,h). (b) Suggest a formula that avoids cancellation errors for computing the approximation (f(zo + h) — f(z0))/h to the derivative of f(z) = sin(z) at z = z,. Write a program that implements your formula and computes an approximation of f(1.2), for h = 1e-20,1e-19,..., 1. (c) Explain the difference in accuracy between your results and the results reported in Example 1.2.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
