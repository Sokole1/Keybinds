To showthat (, 5) = 2(a/2, b/2), we'l use properties of the greatest commondivisor ) &3 & [CEON Given a and b are even integers and not both zero, we can write: a=2m b=2n where m and n are integers. Now, we wantto ind (. b). I 2is a common divisor of @ and b, and since they're both even, their god willbe atleast 2. Threfore, we can factor out the 2 and find the ged o the reduced values: (a,5) = (2m, 2n) From properties of gcd, we know that: (2m, 2n) = 2(m,n) We were also given that: a/2=m b/2=n Plugging in the values, we get: (a,b) = 2(a/2,b/2) Which is what we set out o prove.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
