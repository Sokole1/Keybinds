At times when a matrix A is ill-conditioned and we need to solve a linear system Ax = b, a common approach is to regularize it and solve instead (A+al)y =b. Here « is a small positive scalar. If it is small enough, then the solution y would be close enough to x and at the same time solving for A+ al may be more numerically stable than solving for A. Suppose that A is symmetric positive of size n X n and its eigenvalues are A > A=A > 2 A1 > A >0, As a reminder, the condition number of a symmetric positive definite matrix is given by the ratio between its largest and smallest eigenvalue; in this case it would be A 1 Ko(A) = . o) = 3 (a) Write down a formula for the condition number of A+al, namely Ka2(A + al), in terms of eigenvalues of A and «, and show that A + al is better conditioned than A for any positive a. (b) Given the same matrix A and its eigenvalues as in part (a), sup- pose that we have decided to use an iterative method for solving (A+al)y = b. Suppose that it is known that all the diagonal elements of A are equal to 1. Suppose also that it is known that all eigenvalues of A are larger then 2. State a condition on « for the convergence of the Jacobi scheme for any initial guess, in terms of one or more of the eigenvalues of A.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
