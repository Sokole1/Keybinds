There are blank sheets at the back for rough work. • Show your work, but please avoid unnecessarily lengthy answers. Any- thing not to be marked should be clearly crossed out. 1 Useful formulae The following formulae may be useful when answering the questions and may be used without proof. Mean value theorem: If f (x) is continuous on the interval [a; b], and diﬀerentiable on (a; b), then there exists a point c ∈ (a; b) such that f ′(c) = f (b) − f (a) b − a : Intermediate value theorem: If f (x) is continuous on the interval [a; b], and ˘ is a number such that f (a) < ˘ < f (b); then there exists a c ∈ [a; b] such that f (c) = ˘: Properties of determinants: Let A; B ∈ Rn×n and \u000b ∈ R. Then: det(\u000bA) = \u000bndet(A); det(AB) = det(A)det(B); det(A−1) = (det(A))−1; det(AT ) = det(A): 2 1. A general ﬂoating point system can be characterized by the four values (\f; t; L; U ). Describe the meaning of each of these digits. What is the mantissa and what is the exponent of a ﬂoating point number? Describe two instances when ﬂoating point errors may be magniﬁed. The following identity is given: ln(x − √x2 − 1) = − ln(x + √x2 − 1): (a) Which of the above two (mathematically equivalent) expressions is more suitable for numerical computations if x ≫ 1? Justify your answer. (b) Suggest a formula diﬀerent from the above two that is at least as numerically stable as your answer for part (a) and is more likely to prevent an overﬂow. 3 continue answer here... 4 2. What is meant when we say an iterative method exhibits (i) linear and (ii) quadratic convergence? State (but don’t prove) conditions under which Newton’s method converges quadratically. A ﬁxed point iteration has the form xk+1 = g(xk): Show that, if we apply such an iteration on some interval [a; b] (which you may assume is suﬃciently close to a ﬁxed point ˘ of the function g(x)) then |xk+1 − ˘| ≤ L|xk − ˘|; (1) where L = maxx∈[a;b] |g′(x)|. What is the function g(x) which gives us Newton’s method? Consider the function f (x) = 25x2 − 10x + 1: How fast should we expect convergence of Newton’s method to be? Justify your answer. How well would the bisection method work for this function? 5 continue answer here... 6 3.
