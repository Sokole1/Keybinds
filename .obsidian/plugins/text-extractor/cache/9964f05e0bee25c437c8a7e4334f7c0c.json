Every day, a mischievious thief enters the Queen’s treasury, selects one of her N gems at random and replaces it with one of his N gems, also selected at random. In total, two collectively have N rubies and N saphires. The queen doesn’t mind because she likes both rubys and and saphires and she is interested in probability, so she asks her court scholar the following questions: (a) (1 point) Let R, denote the number of rubies in the vault on day n. Explain why {R,}n>0 is a Markov chain. (b) (3 points) Find the state space S and the transition probabilities P; ; for all i,j € 5. (c) (3 points) Is the Markov chain reversible? Explain why or why not. (d) (5 points) Find the stationary distribution 7 of the Markov chain and verify your answer. (e) (2 points) Suppose that the Queen’s treasury has 1 ruby and N — 1 saphires. How many days on average does it take until she again has exactly 1 ruby? P","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
