One was for an \"assessment\" and the other was for a coding challenge. Both are supposed to be completed within 4 days. | think in my application my first choice was ML/AL. I'll take both some time today and let you know what to expect. O 1L OReply { Award > Share - L@ legoland9 - 6d ago that would be great | just applied hoping to get the assessment soon O 1L OReply { Award > Share - . dire_steaks - 5d ago The assessment was similar to an 1Q test. It is timed, 40 questions in 20 minutes. The questions are easy but you have to move fast. Some were basic math, like \"300 people are invited to a party, if 45% of those invited attend, how many people don't attend?\" Others showed simple drawings and would have you select how many of the drawings on the left were exactly the same as the drawings on the right. If there are differences, they are small, so | think this part was designed to measure your attention to detail. After the timer ran out, it immediately prompts you to complete a workplace behavior quiz, which takes about 10 minutes but there is no time limit. It makes statements like, \"l doubt myself when making important decisions,\" or, \"l feel comfortable in unfamiliar settings,\" and has you select an option out of strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. There are no wrong answers. I haven't taken the coding challenge yet, but plan on taking it today. 18 O Reply £ Award #> Share . dire_steaks - 5d ago | took the coding challenge in Python, and | personally wasn't able to complete it within the 28- minute time constraint. If you've been crushing LC for a while you'd probably be in the right mindset to do it but I'm out of practice and just couldn't get my gears to turn fast enough. It tested things such as data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc), control flow (conditionals), string parsing (splitting and interpreting instructions from a list of strings), mathematical reasoning, state management (like keeping track of variables and updating them as you go), debugging and edge cases, etc etc. It was quite the mental load and felt a little overwhelming in the time constraint given. While | didn't solve it, the final solution was probably at least 25 lines or so. I'd recommend practicing more intermediate level coding challenges before attempting, to get yourself in the right mindset. Best of luck to you all! 18 O Reply £ Award #> Share .
