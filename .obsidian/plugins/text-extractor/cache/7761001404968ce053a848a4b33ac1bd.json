This means we are looking for A such that F — AG is a con- servative vector field. Since F, G are defined on all of R? (which is simply-connected), the second main theorem applies, and we need to find A such that 2D curl(F — AG) = 0. We compute — 81 8?! 2D curl(F — AG) = {z+3y —Az—Ay z+y-— 2A:c+3Ay:| which becomes 1-2A-3+A. Setting this to zero, we obtain —2 — A = 0 which implies A = —2.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
