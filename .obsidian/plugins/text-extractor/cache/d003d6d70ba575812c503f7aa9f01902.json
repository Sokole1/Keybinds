The left end of the rod is also perfectly insulated, meaning no heat escapes or enters at = 0. Meanwhile, the right end at = L loses thermal energy at a rate proportional to its temperature at that point. The initial temperature distribution along the rod is given by the function f(z). The problem is stated as follows: U =0Uy, 0<z<L t>0 uz(0,8) =0, wu,(L,t)+ wku(L,t) =0, (1) u(:c, 0) = f(z)v where k > 0. Use the method of separation of variables to solve the problem (1).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
