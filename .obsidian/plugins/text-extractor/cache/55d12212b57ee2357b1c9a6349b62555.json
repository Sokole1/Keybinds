(a) Consider a matrix A whose sparsity pattern is given by x 0 x A=|[x x 0. 0 x x Here x stands for an arbitrary value, possibly nonzero, and 0 stands for a value that is necessarily zero. Write down the spar- sity patterns of the factors L and U that correspond to the LU decomposition of A. Assume no pivoting is done. There is no need to describe your steps or provide any explanations. (b) Given two nonsingular n x n matrices T and A, suppose the LU decomposition of TA is given: TA= LU, where as usual L is a unit lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. Assume no pivoting needs to be done. Suppose n is large and we now need to solve the linear system Az =b, where A is the same matrix as above and b is a given right-hand side vector. Suggest a way to solve this system within O(n?) floating point operations. There is no need to provide a lengthy algorithm, just state what steps need to be taken and for each step state what the computational cost is.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
