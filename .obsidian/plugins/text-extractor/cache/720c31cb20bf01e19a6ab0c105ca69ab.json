Useful integrals: ∫ 1√a2−x2 dx = arcsin ( x a ) + C, ∫ 1 a2+x2 dx = 1 a arctan ( x a ) + C, ∫ 1 x√x2−a2 dx = 1 a arcsec ( |x| a ) October 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 2 of 5 1. Consider the following initial value problem (I.V.P.): { y′ = x + xy2, y(−1) = 0. (1) (a)(1 points) Prove that the solution to the I.V.P. (1) exists and is unique for y(−1) = 0. Solution: (b)(5 points) Find the explicit solution to the I.V.P. (1) and the open interval of existence of the solution. Solution: (c)(4 points) Use Euler’s method to obtain on approximation of y(1), solution of the I.V.P. (1) at x=1. Use a constant step size h = 1.

A solution containing t gram/liter of salt is being poured into the tank at a constant inlet ﬂow rate Qin = 1 liter/min. At the same time, the solution ﬂows out of the tank at a constant outlet ﬂow rate Qout = 2 liter/min. Let V (t) be the volume in liters contained in the tank at time t minutes and let m(t) be the mass in grams of salt in the tank at time t minutes. (a)(2 points) How long will it take for the tank to be empty? Solution: (b)(6 points) Find the explicit solution to the following I.V.P veriﬁed by the mass of salt m(t): { dm dt + 2 100−t m(t) = t, m(0) = 0. (2) Solution: (c)(2 points) What mass of salt will there be in the tank when 10 liters remain (calculator ready expression)? Solution: October 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 4 of 5 3. Consider the diﬀerential equation: y′ = −y(y2 − a). (a)(5 points) Find and classify (as stable or unstable using the phase diagram) all the critical points when a > 0. Solution: (b)(3 points) Find and classify (as stable or unstable) all the critical points when a ≤ 0. Solution: (c)(2 points) If a = 1 and y0 > 1, what is the long-time behavior of the solution to the diﬀerential equation with initial value y(0) = y0? That is, what is limt→∞ y(t)?
