Consider the closed region enclosed by the curves y = x2 + 4x + 4 and y = 4 − x2. Let C be its boundary and suppose that C is oriented counter–clockwise. (a) Draw the oriented curve C carefully in the xy–plane. (b) Determine the value of ∮ C xy dx + (ey + x2)dy 2. Consider the vector ﬁeld F(x, y, z) = (cos x, 2 + sin y, e z). (a) Compute the curl of F. (b) Is there a function f such that F = ∇∇∇f ? Justify your answer. (c) Compute the integral ∫ C F·dr along the curve C parametrized by r(t) = (t, cos t, sin t) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 3π. 3. Let S be the sphere of radius 3, centered at the origin and with outward orientation. Given the vector ﬁeld F(x, y, z) = (0, 0, x + z): (a) Calculate (using the deﬁnition) the ﬂux of F through S ∫ ∫ S F · ˆn dS That is, compute the ﬂux by evaluating the surface integral directly. (b) Calculate the same ﬂux using the divergence theorem. 4. We consider the cone with equation z = √ x2 + y2. Note that its tip, or vertex, is located at the origin (0, 0, 0). The cone is oriented in such a way that the normal vectors point downwards (and away from the z axis). In the parts below, both S1 and S2 are oriented this way. Let F = ( − zy, zx, xy cos(yz) ). (a) Let S1 be the part of the cone that lies between the planes z = 0 and z = 4. Note that S1 does not include any part of the plane z = 4. Use Stokes’ theorem to determine the value of ∫ ∫ S1 ∇∇∇ × F · ˆn dS Make a sketch indicating the orientations of S1 and of the contour(s) of integration. (b) Let S2 be the part of the cone that lies below the plane z = 4 and above z = 1. Note that S2 does not include any part of the planes z = 1 and z = 4. Determine the ﬂux of ∇∇∇ × F across S2 . Justify your answer, including a sketch indicating the orientations of S2 and of the contour(s) of integration. 1 5. Consider the cube of side length 1 that lies entirely in the ﬁrst octant (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0) with one corner at the origin and another corner at point (1, 1, 1). As such, one face lies in the plane x = 0, one lies in the plane y = 0, and another lies in the plane z = 0. The other three faces lie in the planes x = 1, y = 1, and z = 1. Denote S as the open surface that consists of the union of the 5 faces of the cube that do not lie in the plane z = 0. The surface S is oriented in such a way that the unit normal vectors point outwards (that is, the orientation of S is such that the unit normal vectors on the top face point towards positive z–directions). Determine the value of I = ∫ ∫ S F · ˆn dS where F is the vector ﬁeld given by F = ( y cos(y2) + z − 1 , z x + 1 + 1 , xyez2) 6. Consider the curve C in 3 dimensions given by r(t) = 2tˆııı + t 2ˆ + √3t 2ˆk for t ∈ R. (a) Compute the unit tangent vector T(t). (b) Compute the unit normal vector N(t). (c) Show that the binormal vector B to this curve does not depend on t and is one of the following vectors: 1⃝   1/2 − √3/2 0   2⃝   0√3/2 1/2   3⃝   0 −√ 3/2 1/2   4⃝   0 −1/2√ 3/2   This implies that C is a plane curve. (d) According to your choice of vector 1⃝, 2⃝, 3⃝ or 4⃝, give the equation of the plane containing C. (e) Compute the curvature κ(t) of the curve. (f) Are there point(s) where the curvature is maximal? If yes, give the coordinates of the point(s). If no, justify your answer. (g) Are there point(s) where the curvature is minimal? If yes, give the coordinates of the point(s). If no, justify your answer. (h) Let u := 2ˆııı, v := ˆ + √3 ˆk w := −√3 ˆ + ˆk 2 (i) Express ˆııı, ˆ, ˆk in terms of u, v, w. (ii) Using (i), write r(t) in the form a(t)u + b(t)v + c(t)w where a(t), b(t) and c(t) are functions you have to determine. You should ﬁnd that one of these functions is zero. (iii) Draw the curve given by (a(t), b(t) ) in the xy–plane. (iv) Is the drawing consistent with parts (f) and (g)? Explain. 3","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
