If there are 32 sectors per track, then the time to transfer a single sector is 6/32 or 0.188 ms. If we read the file sequentially, then we'll pay a transfer time for every block and a seektime plus one-half rotation for each block that is not contiguous. Ignoring the first block (as instructed): (NumberO fBlocks — 1) (TransferTime + (1 — LayoutScore) * (Seektime + RotationTime/2)), which is: (89 — 1) * (0.188 + (1 — 0.55) * (5.1 + 6/2)).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
