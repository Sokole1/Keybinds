Use the methods you learned for solving ODEs to solve equations (1) and (2). b. Expand the solutions to equations (1) and (2) as Taylor series about the point x0 = 0. c. Now, for each of equations (1) and (2), assume a power series solution of the form: y(x) = ∞∑ n=0 anxn Obtain a recursion for the coeﬃcients an. Use these recursions to deter- mine the series representation of each solution. Compare these results to the series obtained in part (b) above. 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
