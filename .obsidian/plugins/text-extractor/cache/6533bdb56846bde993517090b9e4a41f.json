Suppose you only have your mobile phone without Internet connection, and you need to approximately compute the cube root of a number b> 0, that is, you need to approximately compute z=Vb. This means that you need to find a number z such that z3 = b. Your mobile phone has a calculator with the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), but no fancy op- erations such as cube root.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
