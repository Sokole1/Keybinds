An instance of the Weighted 3D-Matching optimization problem consists of three disjoint sets of equal size, namely A={ay,ay,...,a,} B = {b1,by,...,bs} C={e,c2,...,cn} and a collection S of triples of the form (a;,bj, cx). Each triple s € S has an associated weight w(s). The problem is to determine max 3 w(s), - ses’ where the max is taken over subsets S’ of S such that no two triples of S’ share a common element. 1. Describe a decision version of the Weighted 3D-Matching optimization problem. 2. Assuming that P # NP, is your decision problem in P or is it NP-complete?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
