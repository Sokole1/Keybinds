This question considers uniform random points on the disc 0 < z? + y2 < 1 with radius 1 centred at the origin. Parts (d) and (e) involve programming; the commands from scipy.stats.uniform helpful — for example scipy.stats.uniform.rvs generates continuous uniform random numbers on a specified interval. (a) A point is uniformly chosen in the unit disk 0 < 22 + 32 < 1. Find the probability that its distance from the origin is less than r, for 0 <r < 1. (b) Compute its expected distance from the origin. (c) Let the co-ordinates of the point be (X,Y). Determine the marginal p.d.f. of X. Are X and Y’ independent?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
