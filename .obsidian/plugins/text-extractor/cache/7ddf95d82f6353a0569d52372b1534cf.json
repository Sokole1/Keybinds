(Showing this is nontrivial and you are not being asked to prove this result, just to use it.) Using Taylor expansions or other means, show that the overall computational work of SOR of reducing the initial error by a constant factor will take only O(n) iterations, compared to the iteration count for Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, which is O(n?). We have already shown this for Jacobi, and there is no need to repeat it or show it for Gauss-Seidel; just show the required result for SOR.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
