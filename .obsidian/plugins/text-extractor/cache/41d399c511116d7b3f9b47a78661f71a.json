We'll first look at curves? that lie in the zy-plane and then move on to curves in 3d. Consider the black curve in the figure below. We'll also assume that the curves of interest are smooth, with no cusps for example, and not straight, so that the radius of curvature 0 < p < oo. d/ S‘ N That figure also contains a (portion of a) red circle that fits the curve really well between the two radial lines that are (a very small) angle d@ apart. So the arclength ds of the part of the black curve between the two radial lines, should be (essentially) the same as the arc length of the circle between the two radial lines, which is p|d@)|, where p is the radius of the circle. (We put in absolute values to take into account the possibility that df could be negative.) Thus ds = p|dé|. When d@ is a macroscopic angle, this is of course an approximation. But in the limit as d§ — 0, we should end up with ds P~ a0 We now have a formula for the radius of curvature, but not in a very convenient form, because to evaluate it we would need to know the arc length along the curve as a function of the angle 8 in the rightmost figure below. We'll now spend some time developing more convenient formulae for p. First consider the three figures below. They all show the same curve as in the last figure. The leftmost figure just shows","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
