Suppose that we use Euler’s method to approximate the solution to the differential equation: d_= dr y The initial condition is y(0.3) = 1 and the step size is h = 0.2. a) Approximate y(0.9) using Euler’s method. Give also your results at each inter- mediate step. Your answers should be accurate to at least 3 decimal places.
