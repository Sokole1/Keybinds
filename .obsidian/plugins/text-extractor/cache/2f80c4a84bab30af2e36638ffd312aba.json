Then F cannot be a conservative vector field. Solution. True. If F is conservative, then [, F - dr = ¢(P,) — ¢(P,) where P, P, are the start and end points of the curve. If C is a closed curve, then the start and end points are the same. So [, F - dr = ¢(P) — ¢(P) = 0. Hence if there’s a closed curve C where the integral is not zero, then F is cannot be conservative.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
