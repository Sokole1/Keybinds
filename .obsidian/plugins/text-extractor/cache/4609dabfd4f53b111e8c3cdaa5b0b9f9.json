For a complete analysis, refer to Chapter 5 of Boyce and DiPrima. Consider the ODE: P(z)y\" + Q(z)y + R(z)y =0, (2.26) Assume that zo = 0 is a regular singular point. Step 1: Indicial equation AA=1)+bA+e=0, (2:27) . - Q=) — lim 293 where b = limz 5 and ¢ = lim ' 55 Step 2: First solution If Ay > Ay are roots of the indicial equation (2.27) then a solution of (2.26) is n(@) =) a.z™™ where ag # 0 ( and can be chosen to be equal to 1) = To obtain ay, we proceed as in the method of power serics.

(2.32) The method for obtaining the second solution depends on the relations between the two roots of the indicial equation. Step 3: Second solution The second linearly independent solution g, is of the form: Case 1: If A, — ), is neither 0 nor a positive integer 1(x) = Y byz\"** where we can choose by = 1 The coefficients b, are obtained exactly as a, but with A = X,. Case 2: If A =Xy =0 2(2) = (@) Inz + 3\" b, (2 — 7)™ for some by, by = where y, is obtained by assuming y, = f(z,) and y, = H_L;_*IL -n Case 3: If A, — ), is a positive integer: 1(z) = ay(z) Inz + anz\"”\\' where we can choose by = 1. To calculate this solution, first try the Frobenius method with ). If we obtain a second solution, then this solution is y,(z) from the previous equation with a = 0. Otherwise, we get infinite coefficients. For this case, we proceed to calculate y,(z) using the following formula: _ 9l = )y )] v Y A=)2 . T","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
