We're also going to use the usual form of PCA where the PCs are normalized (|ju| = 1), and the direction of the first PC is the one that minimizes the orthogonal distance to all data points. We're only going to consider k = 1 component here. 1. What is the first principal component? 1 . L Answer: | 1 -3 2. What is the reconstruction loss (L2 norm squared) of the point (2, ~1,9)? (Show your work.) 3. What is the reconstruction loss (L2 norm squared) of the point (3,0,4)? (Show your work.) Hint: it may help (a lot) to plot the data before you start this question.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
