For a random walk in d dimensions taking i.i.d. steps, we have seen that the expected number of visits to the origin is given by 1 1 \" m= 1 / L, I @m)* Jimmma 1 = 61(K) where ¢; (k) is the characteristic function of a single step. For d = 3, we have discussed the simple random walk on the cubic lattice Z? where the six allowed steps are of the form (+1,0,0), (0,£1,0), (0,0,£1). A random walk on the face-centred cubic lattice takes steps of the form (£1,£1,0), (£1,0,£1), (0, £1,+1) with equal probabilities . (a) Show that o1 1(F) = 3 (cosky cos ks + cos ky cos ks + cos ks cos 1) for the walk on the face-centred cubic lattice. The trigonometric identity cos(z +y) + cos(z — ) = 2cosz cosy is useful here. (b) Deduce that the integrand in (1) has singularities not only for £ = 0 but at eight additional points on the boundary of the Brillouin zone [—, 7]*. (c) Using a Taylor expansion to second order (neglecting all terms beyond the quadratic), argue that the singularity at k = 0 is integrable. (The other singularities are also integrable, leading to the conclusion that m < oo and hence the walk is transient, but you need not show this.)","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
