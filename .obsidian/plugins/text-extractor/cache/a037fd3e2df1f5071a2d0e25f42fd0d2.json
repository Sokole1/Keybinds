(4 points) Consider a block-diagonal nÂ® x n? symmetric positive definite matrix that has dense square n xn blocks around the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Here is an example of a 9 x 9 block-diagonal matrix with 3 x 3 dense blocks: X x x|[0 0 0|0 0 0 X x x[0 0 0[{0 0 O X X x|0 0 0|0 0 O 00 0|{x x x|0 0 0 A= 0 0 0|x x x[0 0 O [. 0 0 0|x x x|0 0 0 00 0[{0 0 O0fx x x 00 0[0 0 0|x x x 00 0[O0 0 0|x x x (a) What is the nonzero structure of the Choleksy factor of A? That is, if A = GGT where G is lower triangular, determine the nonzero structure of G. It is okay to simply write it down for the above 9 x 9 example, or if you prefer, state how G looks for an arbitrary value of n.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
