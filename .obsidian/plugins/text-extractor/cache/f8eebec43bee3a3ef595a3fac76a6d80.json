Suppose that P is an n x n permutation matrix, obtained by inter- changing rows i and j of the n x n identity matrix I,,. (a) What effect does the multiplication PA have on the rows/columns of A? (b) What effect does the multiplication AP have on the rows/columns of A? (c) Explain why P~! = PT. (d) The linear system Ax = b is replaced by the linear system Bx = b, where B = PAPT and b = Pb. Express X in terms of 4,b, and P. (e) Give an instance of a scenario where permutation matrices of the form P are used to improve the numerical stability of direct linear system solvers. There is no need to provide any specific details. (f) Suppose n is very large and we need to use permutation matrices for performing operations such as the ones specified in (a), (b), or (d) in the course of a computation, for example the numerical solution of a large linear system of equations. How much stor- age is needed to store those permutation matrices if we are to implement our program as economically as possible? Explain.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
