Sketch curves and domains considered below. For this question, you will be graded on the presentation and cor- rectness of your logical argument. Make sure that your solution is clearly presented to receive full marks. (a) Let C; be the unit circle centered at the origin oriented counter-clockwise. Com- pute [, F-dr. (b) Let C be the unit circle centered at (5, —5) oriented counter-clockwise. Compute Jo, F - dr. (c) Let C3 be the circle of radius 100 centered at (5, —5) oriented counter-clockwise. Compute [, F-dr. (d) Let D; = R2\\ {(0,0)}. Determine if F* is conservative on D; or not. (e) Let Dy = {(z,y) € R? : y > 0}. Determine if F is conservative on Dj or not. (£) Let Dy = {(z,y) € R? : 1 < (z +2)2 +y? < 4}. Determine if F' is conservative on Ds or not.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
