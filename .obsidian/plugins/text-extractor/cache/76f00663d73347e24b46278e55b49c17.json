Recall that this problem is defined as follows: Given a graph G = (V, E) and a positive integer K, is there a subset V' of V with at least K vertices such that no two vertices of V” are connected by an edge in G (that is, {u,v} ¢ E for all u,v € V') 7 Recall moreover that Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is defined as follows: The input is a collection of m clauses over n boolean variables X1, X, .. Xn. Each clanse is a disjunction of some of the variables or their complements. The problem consists in answering the question “Is there a way to assign truth values to each variable that makes every clause of the instance TRUE? Complete the following reduction from Independent Set to Boolean Satisfiability. You do not need to prove its correctness. 1. |5 marks| For each vertex v; of G, we define","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
