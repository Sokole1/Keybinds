Solve the initial value problem (3xy + y2) + (x2 + xy)y′ = 0, y(1) = 2. (a)(3 points) Verify that µ(x) = x is an integrating factor, that is, x(3xy + y2)dx + x(x2 + xy)dy = 0 is exact. Answer. Let M = x(3xy + y2) = 3x2y + xy2 and N = x(x2 + xy) = x3 + x2y, then My = 3x2 + 2xy, and Nx = 3x2 + 2xy. Then My = Nx. So x(3xy + y2)dx + x(x2 + xy)dy = 0 is exact. (b)(5 points) Solve the initial value problem. Answer. Since M dx + N dy = 0 is exact. Then there exists some ϕ(x, y) such that ϕx = M = 3x2y + xy2, and ϕy = N = x3 + x2y. Since ϕx = 3x2y + xy2, then ϕ(x, y) = ∫ (3x2y + xy2) dx + g(y) = x3y + 1 2 x 2y2 + g(y). Since ϕy = x3 + x2y, then x3 + x 2y = ϕy = x3 + x2y + g′(y), which implies that g′(y) = 0, so g(y) = constant. Hence x3y + 1 2 x2y2 = C. Since y(1) = 2, then 2 + 2 = C, that is, C = 4. Therefore, the solution is: x3y + 1 2 x2y2 = 4. December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 3 of 15 2. A second order chemical reaction can be modeled by the equation dy dx = α(y − p)(y − q), where α, p and q are constants (a)(4 points) Assume that α > 0 and p > q > 0. Find equilibrium points and classify stabilities of these equilibrium points. Answer. Let’s solve α(y − p)(y − q) = 0, since α > 0 and p > q > 0, then y = p or y = q. So we have two equilibrium points: y = p, and y = q. The phase diagram is: So y = p is unstable, y = q is stable. (b)(4 points) Assume that α = 1, p = 0, q = 1 and y(0) = −1, solve the initial value problem and determine the limiting value of y(x) as x → ∞. Answer. Since α = 1, p = 0 and q = 1, then our diﬀerential equation becomes dy dx = y(y − 1). So dy y(y − 1) = dx, that is, ( 1 y − 1 − 1 y ) dy = dx. Then ln \f \f \f \f y − 1 y \f \f \f \f = x + C. Since y(0) = −1 < 0, then y(x) < 0 for all x ≥ 0, then ln ( y − 1 y ) = x + C. Then y(x) = 1 1 − ex+C . Since y(0) = −1, then C = ln 2. So solution is y(x) = 1 1 − 2ex , which implies that lim x→∞ y(x) = 0. December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 4 of 15 (c)(4 points) Assume that α = 1, p = q = 0 and y(0) = 1. Use Euler’s method to approximate y(2) with the step size h = 1. Answer. Since α = 1, p = q = 0 and y(0) = 1, then our diﬀerential equation becomes dy dx = y2, and y(0) = 1. Let f (y) = y2, x0 = 1 and y0 = y(x0) = y(0) = 1, then x1 = x0 + h = 1 y1 = y0 + f (y0)h = 1 + 1 2 = 2 x2 = x0 + 2h = 2 y2 = y1 + f (y1)h = 2 + 2 2 · 1 = 6.

The characteristic equation is r2 + 4r + 13 = (r + 2)2 + 9 = 0 with roots r = −2 ± 3i. (1pt) The general solution is y(t) = c1e−2t cos 3t + c2e −2t sin 3t. (1pt) Hence y′(t) = (−2c1 + 3c2)e−2t cos 3t + (−3c1 − 2c2)e −2t sin 3t. The initial conditions give c1 + 0 = 2, (−2c1 + 3c2) + 0 = 5. (2pt) Thus c1 = 2, c2 = 3, and y(t) = 2e−2t cos 3t + 3e −2t sin 3t. (1pt) (b)(5 points) Find a particular solution of y′′ + 3y′ = e −3t using either the method of undetermined coeﬃcients, or the method of variation of parameters. Answer. #1. (method of undetermined coeﬃcients.) The characteristic equation is r2 + 3r = 0, with roots −3, 0. Hence yc(t) = c1 + c2e −3t. (2pt) For f = e−3t, the initial guess is Y (t) = ae−3t. However ae−3t is part of yc and hence we set Y (t) = ate −3t. (1pt) We have Y ′ = (a − 3at)e −3t, Y ′′ = (−3a − 3a + 9at)e−3t, Y ′′ + 3Y ′ = −3ae−3t. (1pt) Thus a = − 1 3 and Y (t) = − 1 3 te−3t. (1pt) Answer #2. (method of variation of parameters.) The characteristic equation is r2 + 3r = 0, with roots −3, 0. Hence two independent solutions are y1(t) = 1, y2(t) = e−3t. (2pt) A particular solution is of the form Y (t) = y1(t)u1(t) + y2(t)u2(t) with u ′ 1 + e −3t u ′ 2 = 0, 0 u ′ 1 − 3e−3t u ′ 2 = e−3t. Thus u ′ 2 = − 1 3 , u ′ 1 = 1 3 e−3t. (2pt) We can solve u1 = − 1 9 e−3t and u2 = − 1 3 t, and hence Y = 1(− 1 9 e−3t) + e−3t(− 1 3 t) = − 1 9 e−3t − 1 3 te−3t. (1pt) December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 6 of 15 4. Consider a vibrating system described by the initial value problem u ′′ + cu ′ + 4u = cos 2t, u(0) = 0, u ′(0) = 2. where c > 0 is the damping coeﬃcient. (a)(5 points) Find the steady periodic part of the solution (the part of the solution which remains as t → ∞) of this problem, and ﬁnd its amplitude. Do not ﬁnd the transient part. Answer. The steady state is the particular solution of the form U (t) = a cos 2t + b sin 2t. Thus U ′ = 2b cos 2t − 2a sin 2t and U ′′ = −4a cos 2t − 4b sin 2t. Substitution into the equation yields c(2b cos 2t − 2a sin 2t) = cos 2t. Thus a = 0, b = 1 2c , and U (t) = 1 2c sin 2t. Its amplitude is 1 2c . (b)(2 points) Let A(c) denote the maximum amplitude of the steady state solutions of the systems u ′′ + cu ′ + 4u = cos ωt, u(0) = 0, u ′(0) = 2 among all possible ω > 0. What happens to A(c) as c → 0+? Explain why. Hint. You do not need to solve A(c) explicitly. Answer. A(c) goes to inﬁnity, because A(c) ≥ 1 2c and limc→0+ 1 2c = ∞. December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 7 of 15 (c)(6 points) Find a particular solution of y′′ + y = 1 cos t , − π 2 < t < π 2 . Hint: ∫ tan t dt = − ln | cos t|, ∫ cot t dt = ln | sin t| Answer. The homogeneous equation has two independent solutions y1(t) = sin t, y2(t) = cos t. Using the method of variation of parameters, a particular solution is given by Y (t) = y1(t)u1(t) + y2(t)u2(t), in which y1u ′ 1 + y2u ′ 2 = 0, y′ 1u ′ 1 + y′ 2u ′ 2 = f. That is, sin t u ′ 1 + cos t u ′ 2 = 0, cos t u ′ 1 − sin t u ′ 2 = 1 cos t . Thus u ′ 1 = 1, u ′ 2 = − tan t u1(t) = ∫ 1dt = t, u2(t) = − ∫ tan t dt = ln | cos t| = ln(cos t) (− π 2 < t < π 2 ) Hence a particular solution is Y (t) = t sin t + cos t ln(cos t) December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 8 of 15 5.(8 points) Use the Laplace transform to solve the system x′′(t) + 2x′(t) + 2x(t) = 2 with initial conditions x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 0. Answer. Writing X(s) for the Laplace transform of x(t), we obtain (s 2 + 2s + 2)X(s) = 2 s and therefore X(s) = 2 s(s2 + 2s + 2) . By partial fraction decomposition, we have X(s) = −s − 2 s2 + 2s + 2 + 1 s . By completion of the square, this can be put in a convenient form to later apply the ﬁrst shifting formula: X(s) = −(s + 1) (s + 1)2 + 1 − 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 + 1 s . Taking inverse Laplace transforms and applying the said shifting formula, we obtain x(t) = −e−tL−1{ s s2 + 1 } (t) − e−tL −1{ 1 s2 + 1 } (t) + 1 = −e−t(cos t + sin t) + 1. December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 9 of 15 6. (a)(6 points) Solve the system x′′(t) + 4x(t) = δ(t − 2) with initial conditions x(0) = 0 and x′(0) = 0. Answer. Writing X(s) = L{x(t)} and taking Laplace transforms, we obtain (s2 + 4)X(s) = e−2s ⇒ X(s) = e−2s s2 + 4 . By the second shifting formula, we have therefore x(t) = L −1{ 1 s2 + 4 } (t − 2) · u(t − 2) = 1 2 sin(2(t − 2)) · u(t − 2). (b)(6 points) Find the Laplace transform of f (t) =  | | 1 if t < 1 t if 1 ≤ t < 2 0 if t ≥ 2. Answer. We can rewrite the piecewise deﬁnition of f using Heavyside functions: f (t) = 1 · (1 − u(t − 1)) + t · (u(t − 1) − u(t − 2) ) + 0 · u(t − 2) = 1 + (t − 1)u(t − 1) − tu(t − 2) = 1 + (t − 1)u(t − 1) − (t − 2)u(t − 2) − 2u(t − 2). This last expression makes it easier to apply the second shifting formula: F (s) = 1 s + e −sL{t}(s) − e−2sL{t}(s) − 2e−2s s = 1 s + e−s s2 − e−2s( 1 s2 + 2 s ). December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 10 of 15 7. (a)(7 points) Find general solution of dx dt = Ax, A = [ p 4 −1 p ] , assuming that p is real. Answer. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A by solving det(A − λI) = (p − λ)2 + 4 = 0. This gives two complex conjugated eigenvalues λ1,2 = p ± 2i. The eigenvector that corresponds to λ1 = p + 2i is [ −2i 4 −1 −2i ] v1 = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ v1 = [ 2 i ] . The general solution is then given by x = C1Re([ 2 i ] e (p+2i)t) + C2Im([ 2 i ] e(p+2i)t), which can be simpliﬁed to x = C1ept [ 2 cos(2t) − sin(2t) ] + C2ept [ 2 sin(2t) cos(2t) ] . (b)(3 points) Describe the behaviour of the system (do not draw phase portrait) for all possible real values of p. Answer. Since the eigenvalues are λ1,2 = p ± 2i and Re(λ1,2) = p is real, there are only three cases. If p > 0, then the system behaves like a spiral source. If p < 0, then the system behaves like a spiral sink. If p = 0, then the system behaves like a center. December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 11 of 15 8.(12 points) Solve dx dt = Ax − [ 0 3t + 2 ] , x(0) = [ 0 1 ] , A = [ 0 1 3 2 ] . Answer. We start by ﬁnding the complimentary solution. The eigenvalues of matrix A can be found from −λ(2 − λ) − 3 = 0, which gives λ1 = 3 and λ2 = −1. The corresponding eigenvectors are [ −3 1 3 −1 ] v1 = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ v1 = [ 1 3 ] , [ 1 1 3 3 ] v2 = [ 0 0 ] ⇒ v2 = [ 1 −1 ] . The complimentary solution is then xc = C1 [ 1 3 ] e3t + C2 [ 1 −1 ] e−t. Method 1. By undetermined coeﬃcients, we seek for the particular solution in the form xp = at + b, where a and b are constant vectors with unknown components. Substituting xp into the equation gives a = Aat + Ab − [ 0 2 ] − [ 0 3 ] t, which implies that a = Ab − [ 0 2 ] , Aa = [ 0 3 ] . Computing the the inverse of A gives A −1 = 1 3 [ −2 1 3 0 ] , which can be used to ﬁnd a = A−1 [ 0 3 ] = [ 1 0 ] , b = A −1 [ 1 2 ] = [ 0 1 ] . So, the particular solution is xp = [ t 1 ] . Method 2. To use variation of parameters, we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd fundamental matrix solution. Using the obtained complimentary solution, one has X = [ e3t e−t 3e3t −e−t ] , X −1 = 1 4 [ e−3t e−3t 3et −et ] . Particular solution can be found using xp = X ∫ X −1 [ 0 −3t − 2 ] dt = 1 4 [ e3t e−t 3e3t −e−t ] [ ∫ (−3t − 2)e−3t dt∫ (3t + 2)et dt ] . December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 12 of 15 The integrals can be calculated as [ ∫ (−3t − 2)e−3t dt∫ (3t + 2)et dt ] = [ (t + 1)e−3t (3t − 1)et ] . Finally, the particular solution is xp = 1 4 [ e3t e−t 3e3t −e−t ] [ (t + 1)e−3t (3t − 1)et ] = [ t 1 ] . The general solution is x = C1 [ 1 3 ] e3t + C2 [ 1 −1 ] e−t + [ t 1 ] . Using the initial condition gives x(0) = C1 [ 1 3 ] + C2 [ 1 −1 ] + [ 0 1 ] = [ 0 1 ] , which implies that C1 = C2 = 0. Finally, the solution is x = [ t 1 ] . December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 13 of 15 9. Consider the nonlinear system dx dt = x2 − y2 2 + 1, dy dt = −4x − 2y. (1) (a)(5 points) Find the equilibria (critical points) for the system (1). Answer. The equilibria are solutions of the equations x2 − y2 2 + 1 = 0 and −4x − 2y = 0. From the second equation, we obtain y = −2x. Substituting this into the ﬁrst equation, we have −x2 + 1 = 0. Hence the equilibria are (1, −2) and (−1, 2). (b)(6 points) Find the Jacobian (partial derivative) matrix for the system (1), compute the linearized system at each equilibrium, and compute the eigenvalues for each of the coeﬃcient matrices. Answer. The Jacobian matrix is [ 2x −y −4 −2 ] . The linearized system at (1, −2) is [ u′ v′ ] = [ 2 2 −4 −2 ] [ u v ] . The characteristic equation is λ2 + 4 = 0 and the eigenvalues are ±2i. The linearized system at (−1, 2) is [ u′ v′ ] = [ −2 −2 −4 −2 ] [ u v ] . The characteristic equation is λ2 + 4λ − 4 = 0, and the eigenvalues are −4 ± √32 2 = −2 ± 2 √2. December 2014 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 14 of 15 (c)(4 points) Identify the equilibrium of (1) at which the linearized system (not system (1)) has a center. Classify the other equilibrium and indicate whether it is (asymptotically) stable or unstable in system (1). Answer. The eigenvalues of the coeﬃcient matrix for the linearized system at equilibrium (1, −2) are are purely imaginary. Therefore the linearized system at (1, −2) has a center. The coeﬃcient matrix for the linearized system at equilibrium (−1, 2) has a positive eigenvalue and a negative eigenvalue. Hence, the equilibrium is a saddle, which is unstable, in system (1).
