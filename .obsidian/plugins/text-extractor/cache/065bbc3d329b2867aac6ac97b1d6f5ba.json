(a) Find the root using pen and paper only. (b) Use the secant method to find the root starting from zp = 0, z; = 1. Record the absolute errors |z —2*| and the number of iterations & required to obtain | f(zx)| < 10~8. Comment on the observed speed of convergence. (c) What would happen if we use Newton’s method starting from the same x(? (d) It is likely that the same technique you used in part (a) would lead you to believe that the equation Vz+15—yz+15=0 also has the same root, but in fact it does not have a root at all! Explain why. What would happen if one tried to apply Newton’s method from any starting point o > 0?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
