This problem concerns 2-dimensional random walk on the square lattice Z2 (consisting of points (2™, 2®) with 2 and z® both integers). Let X = (X1, X®) be a random vector which takes the values (1,0), (—1,0), (0,1), (0, —1) with equal probabilities 1. For j = 1,2, the marginal p.m.f. of X) takes value 1 with probability 1, —1 with probability }, and 0 with probability }. Let X; be i.i.d. with the same distribution as X, and let 5, = X, +---+ X,,. Then S, represents the position after n steps of a random walker on Z2, starting from (0, 0), whose random steps are equally likely to be any of the four unit vectors. () The expectation of a random vector ¥ = (Y1), Y®) is given by EY = (EYW, EY®) and the variance is given by Var(Y) = E[(Y — EY) - (¥ — EY)] with the dot indicating the dot product. Show that, for the random walk, ES, = (0,0) and Var(§,) = n.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
