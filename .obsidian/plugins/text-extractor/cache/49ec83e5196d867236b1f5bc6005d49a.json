They have a map showing n locations of buildings and outdoor spots on campus. Their k stands need to be set up in the outdoor spots. They want you to select k spots such that the maximum distance from any of the n locations to a stand is as small as possible. Formally an instance of the Strategically Placed Krispy Kremes optimization problem is a set V of size n (the locations), a subset S of V (the outdoor locations), and an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ |S|, as well as a symmetric matrix d[1..n][1..n] of distances between each pair of locations. The optimization problem is to ﬁnd a subset S′ ⊆ S of size k, so as to minimize max v∈V min s∈S′{d(s, v) | s ∈ S′}. The corresponding Strategically Placed Krispy Kremes decision problem, which we’ll call SPKK, is as follows. An instance of SPKK has a set V of size n, a subset S of V , an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ |S|, and a symmetric matrix d[1..n][1..n], plus an additional nonnegative integer b. The problem is to determine if there is a subset S′ ⊆ S of size k, such that max v∈V min s∈S′{d[v][s] | s ∈ S′} ≤ b. (1) 1. Show that the SPKK problem is in NP. 2. Suppose that, in specifying the decision problem, we replace the ”≤” in (2) with ”=”, i.e., max v∈V min s∈S′{d[v][s] | s ∈ S′} = b. (2) Call this new decision problem variant SPKK′. Can we easily adapt our certiﬁcation algorithm from part 1 to SPKK′? 1 2 Reductions: Vertex Cover and Dominating Sets Your task is to ﬁnd a reduction from Vertex Cover to Dominating Sets, two famous graph problems: • Vertex Cover: An instance is a graph G = (V, E) and an integer K. The problem asks: Is there a vertex cover with at most K vertices in G? Here, a vertex cover is a subset W of V such that |W | ≤ K, such that every edge in E has at least one endpoint in W . • Dominating Set: An instance is a graph G = (V, E) and an integer K. The problem asks: Is there a dominating set with at most K vertices in G? Here, a dominating set is a subset W of V such that |W | ≤ K, such that every element of V − W is joined by an edge to an element of W . 1. Give a reduction from Vertex Cover to Dominating Set. Explain why your reduction is correct, and runs in polynomial time. 2. Suppose someone tells you that they have an O(n6) algorithm to solve the Dominating Set problem on a graph with n vertices. What can you say about the time complexity T (n, m) of the Vertex Cover problem on graphs with n nodes and m edges? Choose all answers that apply. T (n, m) ∈ O((n + m)2) T (n, m) ∈ O((n + m)6) T (n, m) ∈ Ω((n + m)2) T (n, m) ∈ Ω((n + m)6) 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
