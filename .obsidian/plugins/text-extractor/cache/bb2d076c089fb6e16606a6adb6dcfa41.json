The number you get should be an estimate, because the layout score suggests a fraction of the blocks that are contiguous, and you may find that that doesn't produce an integral number of blocks. For the purposes of a performance estimate, that's a fine approximation. A disk rotates at a speed of 10000 RPM and has an average seek time of 5.1 ms. A track holds 32 sectors of 4096 bytes each. Assuming the following: « Contiguous blocks are allocated on the same track. « You should ignore the time to read the first block. Given a file of 89 4096-byte blocks with a layout score of 0.55, how long (in ms) will it take to read the entire file sequentially? Round your answer to two decimal places.
