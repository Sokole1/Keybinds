The reason for this is: @ Computing the solution via the QR decomposition is cheaper computationally than other alternatives @ Condition number does not grow and cost is still reasonable @ The Cholesky decomposition for the normal equations cannot be easily computed @ The QR decomposition always generates sparse factors Q and R and other alternatives donâ€™t @ The QR decomposition is more mathematically elegant than other decompositions == F R OBl -+ 4@y nel cam e Your Answer: B","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
