Finally, dividing by 2h and rearranging, we have — _ 2 f(@o) = f@o+h) — f(zo—h) _ h_f'\"(zu) + O(h®). 2h 6 This gives the claimed discretization error expression. In fact, it can be shown that the last term is O(h*), not O(h®). But this hardly matters because the important point is that the error is O(h?). From here, a little bit of programming similar to what you did in Assignment 1 is required.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
