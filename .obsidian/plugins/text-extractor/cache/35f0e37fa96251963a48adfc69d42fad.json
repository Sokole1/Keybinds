November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 2 of 7 1. (a)(5 points) Find the general solution of the equation y′′ + 2y′ + y = 0. Answer. The characteristic equation is r2 + 2r + 1 = 0, which has repeated roots r = −1, −1. Thus a fundamental set of solutions is y1(t) = e−t, y2(t) = te −t. The general solution is Solution: yc(t) = c1e −t + c2te−t. (b)(5 points) Use the method of undetermined coeﬃcients to ﬁnd a particular solution of the equation y′′ + 2y′ + y = 3e −t. Answer. A ﬁrst guess yp(t) = Ae−t is not suitable as it is part of yc. A second guess yp(t) = Ate−t is similarly not suitable. Hence we try yp(t) = At 2e−t. We have y′ p = A(−t 2 + 2t)e−t, y′′ p = A(t 2 − 4t + 2)e−t Thus Ae −t {t 2 − 4t + 2 + 2(−t 2 + 2t) + t2} = 3e −t. We conclude A = 3/2 and Solution: yp(t) = 3 2 t 2e−t.

(1 N = 1 kg·m s2 .) A mass of 1 kg is hung from the spring and is also attached to a viscous damper that exerts a force of 18 N when the velocity of the mass is 3 m/s. If the mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 0.4 m/s, determine its position x(t) at any time t. Here x is the displacement from the equilibrium position measured positive downward. (Hint: The mass spring system has equation mx′′ + cx′ + kx = 0 where m is the mass attached to the spring, c is the damping coeﬃcient so that the damping force is −cx′, and k is the spring constant so that the force is −kx when the spring is stretched by x.) Answer. The spring constant is k = 5/0.2 = 25 (N/m). The damping coeﬃcient is c = 18/3 = 6 (N-s/m). Hence the equation of motion is x′′ + 6x′ + 25x = 0. The initial conditions are x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 0.4. The characteristic equation is r2 + 6r + 25 = 0. Its roots are r = −3 ± 4i. The general solution is x(t) = Ae −3t cos 4t + Be−3t sin 4t. Invoking the initial conditions, we have A = 0 from x(0) = 0, x′(t) = 4Be−3t cos 4t − 3Be−3t sin 4t, x ′(0) = 0.4 = 4B, B = 0.1 Solution: x(t) = 1 10 e−3t sin 4t. November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 4 of 7 (b)(4 points) Suppose a similar (but diﬀerent) system satisﬁes x′′ + x′ + 4x = 0 and the same initial conditions, and is then further applied a periodic force f (t) = 4 cos 2t. Find the steady periodic part of the solution x(t) for large time. Answer. We look for a particular periodic solution of x′′ + x′ + 4x = 4 cos 2t. Try xp(t) = a cos 2t + b sin 2t. We have x′ p = 2b cos 2t − 2a sin 2t, x ′′ p = −4a cos 2t − 4b sin 2t x′′ p + x′ p + 4xp = 2b cos 2t − 2a sin 2t = 4 cos 2t. We conclude a = 0, b = 2. Solution: xper(t) = 2 sin 2t November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 5 of 7 3. (a)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of f (t), where f (t) = { t 0 ≤ t < 2 2 2 ≤ t. Answer. We ﬁrst write f (t) = t + (2 − t)u2(t) = t − (t − 2)u2(t). Wy use the shift formula for the Laplace transform for g(t − 2)y2 = −(t − 2)u2(t) so g(t) = −t. Solution: F (s) = 1 s2 (1 − e −2s). (b)(5 points) Calculate the inverse Laplace transform of F (s) = 1 s 1 s2 + 1 using the integral formula. Answer. The inverse Laplace transform of 1 s2+1 is sin(t). Then we have L −1{ F (s) } = ∫ t 0 sin(τ )dτ = − cos(τ ) \f \ft 0 = − cos(t) + 1. Solution: f (t) = − cos(t) + 1. November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 6 of 7 4. (a)(5 points) Express the inverse Laplace transform of X(s) = 1 s2((s + 1)2 + 4) using the convolution formula (do not evaluate the integral). Answer. The inverse Laplace transform of 1 s2 is t and the inverse Laplace transform of 1 (s+1)2+4 is 1 2 e−t sin(2t). The convolution formula is L −1{ X(s)} = t ∗ 1 2 e −t sin(2t) Solution: L −1{F (s) } = 1 2 ∫ t 0 τ e−(t−τ ) sin (2(t − τ ) )dτ. (b)(5 points) Consider the diﬀerential equation x′′ + bx′ + cx = f (t), x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 0. For what nonzero values of b, c and what forcing term f is the inverse Laplace transform of X(s) from part a) a solution to the diﬀerential equation? Answer. The Laplace transform of the equation is s 2X + bsX + cX = F (s) so X = 1 s2 + bs + c F (s). For this to match part a) we must have b = 2, c = 5, and F (s) = 1 s2 . So f (t) = t. Solution: The values are b = 2 and c = 5 and the forcing is f (t) = t.
