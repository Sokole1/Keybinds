(Recall that the natural numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., while the integers are the numbers ..., -3,-2,-1,0,1, 2, 3, ....) To a human mathematician, this is a perfectly natural thing to do: the natural numbers are a subset of the integers, so 2 and 3 are not only natural numbers but also integers, and we can compute 2 — 3 in the integers.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
