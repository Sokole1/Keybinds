Or, in canonical form with the log-rate parameter n = log A, h(y 1 win = 2D epmsw) s =y hw=% Zm)=c. 2(n) —— y suff. stat. — normalizer support func. The usual conjugate prior for the Poisson distribution is the Gamma, which can be written with a shape parameter a > 0 and a rate parameter 3 > 0 as A~ Gamma(@,8) p(A] &) = o AT exp(—BN) = 5t X exp(~BY), () Zy(a, B) where I is the gamma function, so that e.g. for positive integers n we have I'(n) = (n —1)!, and Z (o, 8) = T'(a)/B*. This is itself a two-parameter exponential family (albeit not written here in canonical form). Let’s define a standard notation § = % Sy 3@; you may or may not find this useful in your answers. Hint: You should be able to use the form of the gamma distribution to solve all the integrals that show up in this question. Use Z, to represent the normalizing constant of the gamma distribution,! and write e.g. a*t and B* as the updated parameters of the gamma distribution in the posterior.
