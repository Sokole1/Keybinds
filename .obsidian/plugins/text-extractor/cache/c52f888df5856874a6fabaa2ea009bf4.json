Let n be a positive integer with n—1 =2, where s is a nonnegative integer and ¢ is an odd positive integer. We say that n passes Miller’s test for the base b if either b' =1 (mod n) or b¥' = —1 (mod n) for some j with 0 < j < s —1. We now show that if n is prime, then n passes Miller’s test for all bases b withn | b.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
