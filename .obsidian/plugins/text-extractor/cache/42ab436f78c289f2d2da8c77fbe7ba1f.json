Here, n1 is the number of 1s, n0 is the number of Os, a gives the value of a, and b gives the value of 8. Can you find the value of & and 3 that optimize the marginal likelihood? (What are they, and what’s the likelihood?) Hint: It may be helpful to parameterize the beta distribution in terms of m = «/(a+ ) (the proportion of 1s) and k = (a+ B) (the “strength” of our belicf in this ratio).? Try setting m to the MLE value of 0 and varying k.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
