Please check the submission day/time on Canvas. §2.5 §2.6 1. ﬁnd the particular solution (using method of undetermined coeﬃcients) and general solution of the given diﬀerential equations, (a) y′′ + y′ + 4y = 2sinht (hint : sinht = et−e−t 2 ), (b) y′′ − 5y′ + 6y = et(cos2t + 4etsint), (c) y′′ + 5y′ + 4y = 3tsin2t, (d) y′′ + 2y′ + 5y = 3e−tcos2t. 2. Find the particular solution of: ty′′ − 2ty′ + 2y = 5t 2 (t > 0), given that y1(t) = t is a solution to homogeneous problem. 3. A mass of 5 kg on a spring with k = 4N/m and a damping constant c. Suppose that F0 = 2N , the forcing function is F0sin(2t), (a) Determine for what values of the damping constant c there will be no practical resonance. (b) Assume c = 2N s/m, ﬁnd the practical resonance frequency and amplitude. Plot the solution for large t (t → ∞). (c) If c vanishes, i.e., c = 0N s/m, ﬁnd the frequency ω at which the response is strongest. For this ω, ﬁnd an expression for x(t), assuming that the motion starts at equilibrium, x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 0. 4. A spring is stretched 6 in by a mass that weighs 8 lb. The mass is attached to a dashpot mechanism that has a damping constant of 0.25 lbs/f t and is acted on by an external force of 4cos(2t) lb. (a) Determine the steady-state response of this system. (b) If the given mass is replaced by a mass m, determine the value of m for which the amplitude of the steady-state response is maximum. 5. Consider the damped spring-dashpot equation, x ′′ + 5x′ + 4x = cos(3t) + 1 (a) Find the particular solution for the equation. (b) Determine the amplitude of the eventual steady oscillation (when t → ∞). 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
