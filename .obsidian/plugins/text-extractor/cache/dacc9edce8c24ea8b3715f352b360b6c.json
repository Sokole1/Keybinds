(a) Provide an efficient algorithm for this LU decomposition (do not worry about ques- tions of memory access and vectorization). (b) What is the sparsity structure of the resulting matrix L (i.e., where are its nonzeros)? (c) How many operations (to a leading order) does it take to solve a linear system Ax = b where A is upper Hessenberg? (d) Suppose now that partial pivoting is applied. What are the sparsity patterns of the factors of A? 5.6.
