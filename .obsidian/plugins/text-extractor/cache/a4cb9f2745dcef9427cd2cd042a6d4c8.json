Fill in the blanks (2+3=5 pts) 1 a) 37100 is congruent to —————— modulo 17. Your answer should be in terms of the least positive residue modulo 17. Ans: Note that 37 is congruent to 3 modulo 17. Hence 37100 is congruent to 3100 modulo 17. Write 100 = 96 + 4 = (16.6) + 4. By FLT, noting that (37,17)=1, we have 3100 = 3 96 · 34 = (3 16)6 · 3 4 ≡ 1 · 34 mod 17 and 34 = 27 · 3 ≡ 10 · 3 = 30 ≡ 13 mod 17. 1b) A solution for the congruence x ≡ 206 mod 210 is ——————. Ans: Since 210 = 5 × 6 × 7 and 5,6, 7 are relatively prime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem we should solve the system x ≡ 1 mod 5, x ≡ 2 mod 6, x ≡ 3 mod 7. Rewrite these as x = 5t + 1, t ∈ Z. Substituting this in the second congruence, we get 5t + 1 ≡ 2 mod 6. This congruence can easily be solved to get t ≡ 5 mod 6. This gives t = 6u + 5, u ∈ Z. Substituing this in the last congruence gives x = 5(6u + 5) + 1 = 30u + 26 ≡ 3 mod 7. Again, write u = 7v + 6, v ∈ Z. Then we get x = 30(7v + 6) + 26 = 210v + 206. This amounts to solving the congruence x ≡ 206 mod 210. OR solve directly using the algorithm explained to solve the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 2. Answer the following: (1+2+2=5 pts) You must show your work or justify your answer. 2a) If p is a prime, then 1p−1+2p−1+· · ·+(p−1)p−1 ≡ −−−−−−−−−−−− mod p. Ans: By FLT, the LHS is congruent to ∑p−1 i=1 1 = (p − 1) modulo p. 1 2b) The remainder when 217 − 1 is divided by 341 is ——–. Ans: Since 341 is a pseudoprime with respect to base 2, we have 2340 ≡ 1 mod 341. As 17 | 340, we have 217 − 1 | 2340 − 1 | 341. Hence 341 divides 217 − 1 and so the remainder is zero. 2c) Deﬁne a Carmichael number and give an example. Ans: A composite integer n that satisﬁes bn−1 ≡ 1 mod n for all positive integers b with (n, n) = 1 is called a Carmichael number. An example is 561. OR 2c) Find the remainder of 67! when divided by 71. Ans: Using Wilson’s theorem, we see that 70! ≡ −1 mod 71. So we have 70 × 69 × 68 × 67! ≡ −1 mod 71. Since 70, 69, 68 are respectively congruent to 1, 2, and 3 modulo 71, we have 1 · 2 · 3 · 67! ≡ −1 mod 71, hence 6.67! ≡ mod 71. We now only need to ﬁnd a modular inverse of 6 modulo 71. Note that 6 · 12 = 72 is congruent to 1 modulo 71. So 12 is a modular inverse of 6 modulo 71, and we get 67! ≡ 12 mod 71. Hence the remainder is 12. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
