(a) et F(o) = =5 ooy [P(s)) Answer. By the first shifting property, we know that 1 -1 _ —ty—1 L7 [F(s)](t) =e\"'L [s(sz+4)] (t). By the partial fraction, we know that 1 _A + Bs+C s(s2+4) s 2447 So we get 1= A(s® +4) + s(Bs + C) = (A + B)s® + Cs + 4A. So we get A+B=0, C=0, 4A=1. Then A = i, B = —% and C = 0. Hence we have ot rr o bos s(s2+4) 4 s 4 2447 So we have . 11 L7 F(s)](t) =e i Zcos(Zt) .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
