Solve the following initial value problems: (a) y′ = xy + y − x − 1, y(0) = 2 (2 points) Hint: the right hand side of the equation can be written as a product (y − α)(x + β). Identify α and β ﬁrst. (b) xy′ + y = sin(x), y(π) = 0, x > 0 (2 points) (c) y′ − 2ty = 3t 2e t2, y(0) = −4 (2 points) 2. We consider the slope ﬁelds plotted in ﬁgures A,B,C,D. (a) Determine, if any, the plot(s) corresponding to an ODE of the form y′ = f (x). Determine, if any, the plot(s) corresponding to an ODE of the form y′ = f (y). How do we call this type of ODE (y′ = f (y))? (1 point) (b) Associate the slope ﬁelds A,B,C,D with their corresponding equation (no justiﬁ- cation needed here) (2 points): (i) f (x, y) = (x − 1) 2 + (y − 1)2 (ii) f (x, y) = (y + 1)sin(y) (iii) f (x, y) = (x − 1)(x + 1) (iv) f (x, y) = y2 + (y − 1) 3 1 3. Suppose that the alcohol is eliminated from the blood stream of a human at a rate k > 0 (measured in inverse seconds) proportional to the amount of the alcohol present. We also assume that the alcohol enters the human’s blood stream at a constant continuous rate R (measured in grammes per second). a) Write the ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation describing the amount of alcohol Q (in grammes) in the blood stream (2 points). b) If Q(0) = Q0, ﬁnd the solution to the initial value problem (2 points). c) What limit value reaches the solution when t → ∞ (1 point)? 4. Consider the following ordinary diﬀerential equation: y′ = (y2 − 1)(y − 4) a) Find all equilibrium solutions of the equation, and sketch the function correspond- ing to the right hand side of the equation. (2 points) 2 b) Determine the stability of the equilibium solutions you found on a). Sketch the corresponding phase line. (1 point) c) Sketch the solution curves. How does the solution verifying y(−1) = 0.5 behaves as t → ∞? How does the solution veryﬁng y(0) = 2.5 behaves as t → ∞? (2 points) 5. Suppose that we use Euler’s method to approximate the solution to the diﬀerential equation: dy dx = x2 y The initial condition is y(0.3) = 1 and the step size is h = 0.2. a) Approximate y(0.9) using Euler’s method. Give also your results at each inter- mediate step. Your answers should be accurate to at least 3 decimal places. (3 points) b) Find the solution of the initial value problem using the separation of variables method. (1 point) c) Provide the value of the solution at x = 0.9.
