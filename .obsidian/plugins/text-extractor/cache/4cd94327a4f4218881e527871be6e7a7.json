A race track between two hills is described by the parametric curve r(θ) = (4 cos θ , 2 sin θ , 1 4 cos(2θ) ), 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π (a) Compute the curvature of the track at the point ( − 4, 0, 1 4) . (b) Compute the radius of the circle that best approximates the bend at the point( − 4, 0, 1 4) (that is, the radius of the osculating circle at that point). (c) A car drives down the track so that its position at time t is given by r(t 2). (Note the relationship between t and θ is θ = t 2). Compute the following quantities. (i) The speed at the point ( − 4, 0, 1 4). (ii) The acceleration at the point ( − 4, 0, 1 4) . (iii) The magnitude of the normal component of the acceleration at the point( − 4, 0, 1 4). 4.

(b) Compute the integral ∫ CR F · dr directly using a parameterization, where CR is the circle of radius R, centered at the origin, and oriented in the counterclockwise direc- tion. (c) Is F conservative? Carefully explain how your answer ﬁts with the results you got in the ﬁrst two parts. (d) Use Green’s theorem to compute ∫ C F · dr where C is the triangle with vertices (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1) oriented in the counterclockwise direction. (e) Use Green’s theorem to compute ∫ C F · dr where C is the triangle with vertices (−1, −1), (1, 0), (0, 1) oriented in the counterclockwise direction. 7.
