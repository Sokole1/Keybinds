Consider random variables X, Y, Z with Z ~ Bernoulli(1/2), X ~ Unif(0,1), and ¥ ~ Unif(0,1). Prove or disprove the following statement: Cov(X,Y) >0 < E(Cov(X,Y |Z)) >0. Note: the conditional covariance is defined in terms of the conditional expectation in the same way that the covariance is defined in terms of the expectation: Cov(X,Y |2) = E[(X — E(X|2))(Y — E(Y|2)) |Z].","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
