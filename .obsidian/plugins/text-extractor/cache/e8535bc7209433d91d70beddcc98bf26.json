Find a particular solution of the following system, given that X is a fundamental matrix for the complementary system: x′ = 1 t [ 1 t −t 1 ] x + t [ cos t sin t ] ; X = t [ cos t sin t − sin t cos t ] 5. Determine the critical points and the linearizations for the following systems: (a) x′ = (2 + x)(y − x), y′ = (4 − x)(y + x) (b) x′ = x − x2 − xy, y′ = 3y − xy − 2y2 6. Determine the critical points and the linearizations for the following systems: (a) x′ = (1 + x) sin y, y′ = 1 − x − cos y (b) x′ = 1 − xy, y′ = x − y3 7. The equation of motion of an undamped pendulum can be written as: dx dt = y, dy dt = −ω2 sin x with ω a constant corresponding to an angular frequency. Determine the critical points of the system, and determine if the system is locally linear in the neighborhood of each critical point. 8. For the systems below, ﬁnd and classify the critical points (this includes a discussion of stability): (a) x′ = x + x2 + y2, y′ = y − xy (b) x′ = −2x − y − x(x2 + y2), y′ = x − y + y(x2 + y2) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
