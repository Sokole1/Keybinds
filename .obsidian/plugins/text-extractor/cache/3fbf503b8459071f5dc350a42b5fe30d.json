A race track between two hills is described by the parametric curve N 1 r(0) = (4cas€, 2sind, 4—cos(29)), 0<f<2r (a) Compute the curvature of the track at the point (—4,0,%). (b) Compute the radius of the circle that best approximates the bend at the point (—4,0,1) (that is, the radius of the osculating circle at that point). (c) A car drives down the track so that its position at time ¢ is given by r(t2). (Note the relationship between ¢ and is 6 = t2). Compute the following quantities. (i) The speed at the point (—4,0,}). (ii) The acceleration at the point (— 4,0, 3‘). (iii) The magnitude of the normal component of the acceleration at the point (-4,0,1). 10,1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
