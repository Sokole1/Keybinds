Let c ∈ R be a constant. Let F = (cx + cos z, y, cxz) be a vector ﬁeld in R3. Let S1 be the upper hemisphere with upward normal: x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 and z > 0. Let S2 be the lower hemisphere with upward normal: x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 and z < 0. Find c such that ∫ ∫ S1 F · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ S2 F · ˆn dS. 4. Let ⃗F (x, y, z) = ⟨z, x, y⟩. Let C be the curve of intersection between the plane z = 2x + 2y − 1 and the paraboloid z = x2 + y2 oriented counter-clockwise, when viewed from above, say, at the point (0, 0, 100). Compute the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r . 5. Let S be the boundary of the cube [−1, 1] 3 excluding the portion on the plane z = −1. In other words, it consists of the top and the four sides of the cube, except for the bottom, and it is oriented outward. Evaluate ∫ ∫ S curl ⃗F · ˆndS for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = ⟨x2yz, xy, xyz2⟩. 6. Let C be the curve of intersection of the saddle z = y2 − x2 and the cylinder x2 + y2 = 1 oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above. Compute the line integral ∫ C ⃗F·d⃗r for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = ⟨x2y, x 3/3, xy⟩. 7.
