The beacons are placed on mountain peaks or high hills, and the smoke/flame from the fire can alert nearby people, triggering a chain of beacons over several hundreds of kilometers, eventually reaching a target. The problem is to select the optimal locations for a chain of beacons that can send a distress signal from a source hill to a target hill. Besides the source and target hills, a set of nâ€”2 other intermediate hills have been identified as potential spots to place beacons. All n hills lie on a straight path between the source and target. A table D specifies the distance (in kilometers) from the source to each hill, sorted from source to target. You can assume that no two entries of the table are equal, and that two successive hills are always at most 100km apart. For example: i|1(source) | 2 | 3 | 4 5 | 6 (target) D(3) 0 80 | 90 | 140 | 190 230 Some potential locations for the intermediate beacons are more likely to successfully transmit the signal, after having observed the flame/smoke from a designated preceding beacon. (Some locations might be less visible, or have difficult weather conditions.) We are also given a table of the probabilities that each beacon will successfully transmit the signal to a successor that is within 100km. You can assume that P(1) = 1, and that each transmission probability is non-zero, as in the following example: i| 1 (source) | 2 | 3| 4|5 |6 (target) P(i) 1 819].7]5 NA A walid solution to the problem is a chain of hills from the source but not including the target, with successive hills no more than 100km apart and the last hill in the chain no then 100lm from the target. An optimal solution is a valid solution such that if the source beacon is lit, the signal will be received at the target (hill n) with maximum probability. You should assume that the guards assigned to a beacon in a chain would only light their beacon if they see the signal from the preceding beacon in the chain, even if an earlier beacon in the chain might be visible within 100km. As a result, the probability that a signal reaches the target along a valid chain is the product of the transmission probabilities of beacons in the chain. For our example, if beacons are placed on hills 1,3, and 5, then the probability that the signal reaches the target is (1)(.9)(.5) = 0.45.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
