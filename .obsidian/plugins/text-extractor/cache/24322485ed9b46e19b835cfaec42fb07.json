Emalions consistof three aspects, .., subjective feelings, physiologica responses, and behaviors, and the three factors are only weakly correlated. Subjective feelings are usually determined by asking the target person (or other exteal persons) to rate their staes, but such subjective data are highly ambiguous and biased. Another problem is the explainabiltyof the model (L. modafs decision making should be understandable to humans), since emolions are srongly associated with human thinking, atudes, and decision making. To capture subjective emotions as comprehensively as possible, forced catogory chaice is o suffcent; other methods, such as res verbal expressions, are needed. Wit the gosl of combating these various problems, planned topis for this project wil incude probabiistc modeling of personaized emlions, reproducibilty considerations, response stylebias removal, explainabiltyfransparency, and natural language processing.
