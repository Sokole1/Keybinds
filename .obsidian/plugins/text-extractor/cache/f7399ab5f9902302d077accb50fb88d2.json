The left end of the rod is also perfectly insulated, meaning no heat escapes or enters at x = 0. Meanwhile, the right end at x = L loses thermal energy at a rate proportional to its temperature at that point. The initial temperature distribution along the rod is given by the function f (x). The problem is stated as follows: ut = α2uxx, 0 < x < L, t > 0 ux(0, t) = 0, ux(L, t) + κu(L, t) = 0, u(x, 0) = f (x), (1) where κ > 0. Use the method of separation of variables to solve the problem (1). Question 2 (submit) Let c, L > 0 and let f, g : [0, L] → R be functions of class C3, satisfying the boundary conditions f (0) = f (L) = 0 and g(0) = g(L) = 0. We seek to ﬁnd u = u(x, t), a solution to the wave equation:  ||| ||| utt = c2uxx, x ∈ (0, L), t > 0, u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0, t > 0, u(x, 0) = f (x), x ∈ (0, L), ut(x, 0) = g(x), x ∈ (0, L). 1. Show that the solution of the problem in the form u(x, t) = T (t)X(x), ignoring the initial conditions u(x, 0) = f (x) and ut(x, 0) = g(x), is given by: u(x, t) = ∞∑ n=1 [an cos (nπc L t ) + bn sin (nπc L t )] sin (nπ L x) . 2. Determine the constants an and bn by applying the initial conditions u(x, 0) = f (x) and ut(x, 0) = g(x); Deduce the general solution of the problem. 3. Discuss the special case where f = 0 and g(x) = sin ( π L x) − sin ( 2π L x) . Question 3 (do not submit) 1. Determine whether the method of separation of variables can be used to replace the following PDE’s by a pair of ODE’s. If so, ﬁnd the equations: x2uxx = tut uxx + (x + y)uyy = 0 1 2. Consider the 2D heat diﬀusion equation ut = α2 (uxx + uyy) . Let the solution have the form u(x, y, t) = X(x)Y (y)T (t). Find the ODEs that are satisﬁed by X(x), Y (y) and T (t).
