Exercises 67 (a) Derive a third order method for solving f(z) = 0 in a way similar to the derivation of Newton’s method, using evaluations of f(zx), f’(zx) and f”(zx). To do this, use Taylor’s expansion with three terms plus a remainder term. Show that in the course of derivation a quadratic equation arises, and therefore two dis- tinct schemes can be derived. Use considerations of the sort we have extensively discussed in Chapter 1 to determine the preferred scheme. (b) Show that, under the appropriate conditions, the order of convergence is cubic. (c) Estimate the number of iterations and the cost needed to reduce the initial error by a factor of le-10. (d) Write a program for solving the problem of Exercise 2.5. Assess the results. (e) Can you speculate what makes this method less popular than Newton’s method, despite its cubic convergence? Give two reasons.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
