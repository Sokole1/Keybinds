There is no need to justify your answers; just write T/F at a visible place. (a) If Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting is performed on a nonsingular matrix A and the LU decomposition PA = LU is obtained, then all entries of the unit lower triangular matrix L are necessarily smaller than or equal to 1 in absolute value. (b) If Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting is performed on a nonsingular matrix A and the LU decomposition PA = LU is obtained, then all entries of the upper triangular matrix U are necessarily smaller than or equal to 1 in absolute value. (c) Suppose we numerically solve a linear system Ax = b and obtain a numerical solution X. If the norm of the relative residual “‘—’”%/\"‘3“ is small and the condition number of A satisfies K(A) = 1, then the norm of the relative error ﬂ’l“%ﬂ is also necessarily small. (d) In the solution of the linear least-squares problem miny ||b — Ax||2, where A is m x n with m > n, the residual associated with the solution, namely r = b — Ax, necessarily satisfies ATr=0. (e) An orthogonal projector, i.e., a symmetric matrix P that satisfies P? = P, is an orthogonal matrix. (f) Given a vector u with |lul|z = 1, the corresponding Householder reflector H = I — 2uu” is symmetric positive semidefinite.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
