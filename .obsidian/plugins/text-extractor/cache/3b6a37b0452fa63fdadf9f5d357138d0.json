Let ⃗F be a smooth vector ﬁeld deﬁned on R3 such that∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for all closed curves C. Then ∇ × ⃗F = ⃗0. Answer: (b) True or False. Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = (y, 0). Let C be any path from (0, 0) to (1, 0). The line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r does not depend on the choice of path C. Answer: Page 3 of 10 2. 6 marks Please place your answers in the boxes provided.
