(b) A symmetric matrix B is positive semidefinite if z7 Bz > 0 for any vector z. (As areminder, B would be positive definite if 27 Bz > 0 for any vector z # 0.) Use this definition to show that if A is any matrix of dimensions m-by-n, with m > n, ATA is symmetric positive semidefinite. (c) Suppose A is a matrix of dimensions m-by-n, with m > n. Con- sider the linear system (ATA +~I)z = ATb, where Â« is a positive scalar. Can the Cholesky decomposition be used to solve this linear system?
