If pages are 4096 bytes, PTEs are 4 bytes, and each PTE requires five bits of metadata, what is the maximum number of physical pages that this machine can support? Assume that this architecture, unlike the x86, allows the page number to occupy bit positions in the PTE that overlap with offset bits in the address.
