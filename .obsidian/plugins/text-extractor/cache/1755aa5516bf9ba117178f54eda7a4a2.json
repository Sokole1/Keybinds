Please check the submission day/time on Canvas. §8.2, §8.3 1. For the systems below, ﬁnd and classify the critical points (this includes a discussion of stability). (a) x′ = (x − 1) 2 + y, y′ = y + x2. (b) [x′ y′ ] = [ yex y − x + y2 ]. 2. For the systems below, ﬁnd and classify the critical points. (a) [x′ y′ ] = [−x + x2 y ] , (b) [x′ y′ ] = [y − y2 + x −x ], (c) [x′ y′ ] = [ xy x + y − 1 ]. 3. (8.3.2 partial) Suppose the hares do not grow exponentially, but logistically. In particular consider x′ = (0.4 − 0.01y)x − γx 2, y′ = (0.003x − 0.3)y. For the following two values of γ, ﬁnd and classify all the critical points in the positive quadrant, that is, for x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. a) γ = 0.001, b) γ = 0.01. Remark. You can skip the following in the original problem: “Then sketch the phase diagram. Discuss the implication for the long term behavior of the population.” It helps to give intuition. 4. Consider a competition model between two species x′ = f (x, y) = x(1 − x − cy), y′ = g(x, y) = y(1 − cx − y), where c > 0. For example, x(t) and y(t) may be the populations (in thousands) of foxes and coyotes in British Columbia, and they compete for similar food and resource. The parameter c measures how much they harm each other. (a) Find the condition on c such that the system has exactly 4 critical points O(0, 0), P (1, 0), Q(0, 1), and R(x0, y0) with x0 > 0 and y0 > 0. Find R. In the remaining questions we assume c > 0 satisﬁes the condition in part (a). (b) Compute the Jacobian matrices at the four critical points. Show that O is always unstable. (c) (One species extinction.) Find the range of c such that R is unstable. Show that, in this case, both P and Q are stable. This is the case that (almost) only one species will survive and the other species goes extinct. (d) (Co-existence.) Find the range of c such that R is stable. Show that, in this case, both P and Q are unstable. This is the case that both species can live happily ever after. 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
