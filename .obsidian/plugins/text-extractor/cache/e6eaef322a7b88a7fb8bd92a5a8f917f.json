An astrophysicist performs an experiment to measure the distance d in light years between two stars, but her measurements are not completely accurate due to experimental errors. Suppose that each measurement is an independent random variable with mean equal to the true distance d and variance 9 (light years)?. She uses the average of her measurements as an estimate for d. Using the central limit theorem, determine the number of measurements needed to be 95% confident that the estimated distance is within +1 light year of the true distance.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
