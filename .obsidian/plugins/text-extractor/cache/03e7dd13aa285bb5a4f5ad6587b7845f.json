Show that if n is an odd composite integer and n is a pseudoprime to the base a, then n is a pseudoprime to the base n − a. Hint: Use the Binomial Theorem (3pts) 2. The integers Fn = 22n + 1 are called Fermat Numbers. Fermat conjectures that these integers are primes. Indeed, the ﬁrst few Fermat numbers are primes, namely F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, and F4 = 65, 537 and these are all prime numbers. However F5 = 2 25 + 1 is divisible by 641 and is not prime! Show that every composite Fermat number Fm = 22m + 1 is a pseudoprime to the base 2. (3 pts) 3. Show that 25 is a strong pseudoprime to the base 7. (3 pts) 4. Show that if p is prime and 2p − 1 is composite, then 2p − 1 is a pseudoprime to the base 2. (4pts) 5. You are given that 218 ≡ 1 mod 1387 and 21387 ≡ 2 mod 1387 and that 2 · 693 = 1386 = 1387 − 1. Suppose also that 2693 ≡ 512 mod 1387. What can you conclude about 1387? (3pts) 6. Show that every Carmichael number is odd using the deﬁnition of a Carmichael number. Prove that 10, 585 = 5 · 29 · 73 is a Carmichael number. (4pts) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
