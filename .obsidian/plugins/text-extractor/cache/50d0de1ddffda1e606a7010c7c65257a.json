Proof. Since a = b (mod m,), @ = b (mod my),..., a = b (mod my), we know that m, | (@ = b)m; | (@ = b)....my |(a=b). From problem 20 of Section 2.3, we sce that [mymamy] | (@ = b). Consequently, a = b (mod [mymy,..m)). O An immediate and useful consequence of this theorem is the following result. Corollary 3.2. Ifa = b (mod m;), a = b (mod my),.., a = b (mod m;) where @ and b are integers and mmy,...my are relatively prime positive integers, then a =b (mod mymy -+ - my).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
