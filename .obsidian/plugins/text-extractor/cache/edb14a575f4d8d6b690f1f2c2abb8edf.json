Y Thus: 1. if the columns of A are linearly independent (i.e. A not singular) the only way to have V Ax=0isthatx =0 2. if the columns of A are linearly dependent (i.e. A singular) you may have Ax = 0 also for x#0 Share Cite Follow answered Dec 16, 2017 at 23:07 @ user 152k Â®12 W76 A141","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
