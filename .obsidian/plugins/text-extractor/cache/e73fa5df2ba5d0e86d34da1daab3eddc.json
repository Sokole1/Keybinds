November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 2 of 6 1. (a)(5 points) Find a particular solution to y′′ + 3y = 9x2 + 3x. Answer. Let’s try yp = Ax2 + Bx + C, so that we have to solve 2A + 3(Ax2 + Bx + C) = 9x2 + 3x. Then we have 3A = 9, 3B = 3, and 2A + 3C = 0. Therefore A = 3, B = 1 and C = −2. So a particular solution can be yp = 3x2 + x − 2 . (b)(5 points) Find the inverse Laplace transform f (t) of F (s) = 4 s(s2 + 4) . Answer. By the partial fractions, we have 4 s(s2 + 4) = A s + Bs + C s2 + 4 = A(s2 + 4) + s(Bs + C) s(s2 + 4) = (A + B)s2 + Cs + 4A s(s2 + 4) . Then A + B = 0, C = 0, and 4A = 4. So we have A = 1, and B = −1, and C = 0. That is we have 4 s(s2 + 4) = 1 s − s s2 + 4 . By looking up the table, we know that L −1 [ 1 s ] = 1, and L−1 [ s s2 + 4 ] = cos(2t). Then we know that f (t) = L −1[F (s)] = L −1 [ 1 s ] − L−1 [ s s2 + 4 ] = 1 − cos(2t). November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 3 of 6 2. (a)(5 points) Find a particular solution to y′′ + 2y′ + y = 2e−x using the method of undetermined coeﬃcients. Answer. Trying y = Ae−x or y = Axe−x fails (one obtains y′′ + 2y′ + y = 0), so we try y = Ax2e−x. We have y = Ax2e −x, y′ = A(2x − x2)e−x, y′′ = A(2 − 4x + x2)e−x. Therefore y′′ + 2y′ + y = Ae −x(2 − 4x + x2 + 4x − 2x2 + x2) = 2Ae −x. We set A = 1 to make the RHS equal to 2, and obtain the particular solution y = x2e−x . (b)(5 points) Find a particular solution to the same equation y′′ + 2y′ + y = 2e−x, this time using the method of variation of parameters. Answer. The associated homogeneous equation y′′ + 2y + 1 = 0 has a characteristic equation (r + 1)2 = 0, with unique root r = 1. Therefore it admits two linearly independent solutions y1 = e−x, y2 = xe−x. Following the method of variation of parameters, we try y = y1u1 + y2u2, where u1 and u2 are two functions satistfying the system of equations y1u ′ 1 + y2u ′ 2 = 0, y′ 1u ′ 1 + y′ 2u ′ 2 = 2e−x. Computing the derivatives of y1, y2, this becomes e −xu ′ 1 + xe−xu ′ 2 = 0 −e−xu ′ 1 + (1 − x)e−xu ′ 2 = 2e −x. The ﬁrst line gives u′ 1 = −xu′ 2, which can be inserted in the second line to obtain e−xu′ 2 = 2e−x. Therefore u′ 2 = 2 and u2 = 2x, and consequently u′ 1 = −2x and u1 = −x2. Finally, we obtain the particular solution y = −x2e −x + 2x · xe−x = x2e −x. November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 4 of 6 3. Suppose the displacement x(t) of a damped mass-spring system subject to sinusoidal forcing of amplitude F0 is modelled by: x′′ + 4x′ + 13x = F0 sin(t), x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 1. (a)(5 points) Find the solution x(t) when F0 = 0 (no forcing). Answer. The characteristic equation is r2 + 4r + 13 = 0. Its roots are r = −2 ± 3i. The general solution to the homogeneous equation is x(t) = e−2t(c1 cos 3t + c2 sin 3t). (1) Thus x′(t) = e −2t[(−2c1 + 3c2) cos 3t + (−3c1 − 2c2) sin 3t]. Invoking the initial conditions, 0 = c1, 1 = −2c1 + 3c2. Thus c1 = 0, c2 = 1/3, and x(t) = 1 3 e −2t sin 3t. (2) (b)(5 points) Now take F0 = 40, and ﬁnd the steady periodic solution (the part of the solution x(t) which remains as t → ∞). Do not ﬁnd the transient part. Answer. The steady periodic solution is a particular solution of the form U (t) = A cos t + B sin t. In view of (1), there is no resonance and it needs no modiﬁcation. We have U ′ = B cos t − A sin t, U ′′ = −U , and U ′′ + 4U ′ + 13U = (12A + 4B) cos t + (12B − 4A) sin t = 40 sin t. Thus 12A + 4B = 0, 12B − 4A = 40. We get B = −3A, A = −1, B = 3. Thus U (t) = − cos t + 3 sin t. (3) Remark. xp(t) = e−2t(c1 cos 3t + c2 sin 3t) − cos t + 3 sin t is the general form of particular solutions. The steady periodic solution is the unique one among them with c1 = c2 = 0. November 2014 Math 215/255 Midterm Exam II Page 5 of 6 4. (a)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of the solution to the following initial value problem: x′′ − x′ + x = f (t), x(0) = 0, and x′(0) = 1, where f (t) = { 1, if 0 ≤ t < 1, t, if t ≥ 1. Answer. Let X(s) = L[x(t)], apply the Laplace transform on the both sides of x′′ − x′ + x = f (t), then L[x′′] − L[x′] + L[x] = L[f (t)]. By the transforms of derivatives (No. 14 in the table), we have L[x′] = sL[x] − x(0) = sX(s), and L[x′′] = s2L[x] − sx(0) − x ′(0) = s2X(s) − 1. Then we have s2X(s) − 1 − sX(s) + X(s) = L[f (t)], tht is, X(s) = 1 + L[f (t)] s2 − s + 1 . By the deﬁnition of f (t), we know that f (t) = 1 − u(t − 1) + tu(t − 1) = 1 + (t − 1)u(t − 1). By looking up the table, we have L[f (t)] = L[1] + L[(t − 1)u(t − 1)] = 1 s + e−sL[t] = 1 s + e−s s2 . So we know that X(s) = 1 + 1 s + e−s s2 s2 − s + 1 = 1 s2 − s + 1 + 1 s(s2 − s + 1) + e−s s2(s2 − s + 1) . (b)(5 points) Solve the initial value problem: x′′ + x′ = δ(t − 1), x(0) = x′(0) = 0. Answer. Let X(s) = L[x(t)], apply the Laplace transform on the both sides of x′′ − x′ = δ(t − 1), then L[x′′] + L[x′] = L[δ(t − 1)]. By the transforms of derivatives (No. 14 in the table), we have L[x′] = sL[x] − x(0) = sX(s), and L[x′′] = s2L[x] − sx(0) − x′(0) = s2X(s). Then we have s2X(s) + sX(s) = L[δ(t − 1)]. By looking up the table, we have L[δ(t − 1)] = e−s, which implies that X(s) = e−s s2 + s . By the partial fractions, we have 1 s2 + s = 1 s − 1 s + 1 . By looking up the table, we have x(t) = L −1 [ e−s s ] −L −1 [ e−s s + 1 ] = u(t−1)−u(t−1)L −1 [ 1 s + 1 ] (t−1) = u(t−1)−u(t−1)e−(t−1).
