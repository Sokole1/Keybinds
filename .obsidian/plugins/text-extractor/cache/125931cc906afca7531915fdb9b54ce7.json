Given two column vectors x =      x1 x2 ... xn  | | |  and y =      y1 y2 ... yn  | | |  of length n, for each of the questions below, write down a single Matlab command, without using a loop, that computes the given quantity. It is okay to use any Matlab built-in commands that you are aware of. (a) The element-wise product, namely the vector z whose elements are given by      z1 z2 ... zn  | | |  =      x1 · y1 x2 · y2 ... xn · yn  | | |  . (b) The inner product, namely the scalar a = xT y. (c) A diagonal matrix, D, whose diagonal elements are xi + yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. (d) The quantity c = √ (x1 − y1)2 + (x2 − y2)2 + · · · + (xn − yn)2. 2. State one advantage and one disadvantage that Newton’s method has over the secant method for solving a nonlinear scalar equation of the form f (x) = 0. 3. Suppose you only have your mobile phone without Internet connection, and you need to approximately compute the cube root of a number b > 0, that is, you need to approximately compute x = 3√b. This means that you need to ﬁnd a number x such that x3 = b. Your mobile phone has a calculator with the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), but no fancy op- erations such as cube root. (a) Suggest an iterative procedure based on Newton’s method that will allow you to compute such an approximation, using your phone’s calculator. You may assume that you have a pretty good initial guess close to the number you are trying to compute. (b) Suppose (perhaps ﬁctionally) that your calculator happens to have a double precision ﬂoating point system (with machine round- ing unit of approximately 10−16), but the screen displays only eight decimal digits. If the initial guess is correct to one decimal digit, i.e., the initial error is approximately 0.1, within how many iterations do you expect to converge to a result that would be seen as correct or nearly correct on the screen of your phone’s calculator? (c) If you have done everything correctly, you should be quite satis- ﬁed with your procedure. Alas, to further check your work you tried to see what happens when you extend your procedure to compute x = 3√0 (the answer of which is 0) with an initial guess x0 = 0.1 and you found out that convergence is much slower than you have observed for a set of positive numbers you have previously tested. Explain why this is so. 4. Linear algebra review. Determine whether following statements are true or false. In each case, justify your answer. (In the questions below, by saying “may be singular” we mean that we can ﬁnd an example where such a matrix is singular.) (a) An orthogonal projector (a symmetric matrix P that satisﬁes P 2 = P ) may be singular (b) An orthogonal matrix may be singular (c) A symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix may be singular (d) A tridiagonal matrix may be singular (e) A lower triangular matrix may be singular 5. Suppose that P is an n × n permutation matrix, obtained by inter- changing rows i and j of the n × n identity matrix In. (a) What eﬀect does the multiplication P A have on the rows/columns of A? (b) What eﬀect does the multiplication AP have on the rows/columns of A? (c) Explain why P −1 = P T . (d) The linear system Ax = b is replaced by the linear system B ˜x = ˜b, where B = P AP T and ˜b = P b. Express ˜x in terms of A, b, and P . (e) Give an instance of a scenario where permutation matrices of the form P are used to improve the numerical stability of direct linear system solvers. There is no need to provide any speciﬁc details. (f) Suppose n is very large and we need to use permutation matrices for performing operations such as the ones speciﬁed in (a), (b), or (d) in the course of a computation, for example the numerical solution of a large linear system of equations. How much stor- age is needed to store those permutation matrices if we are to implement our program as economically as possible? Explain. 6. A company that deals with certain ﬂuid ﬂow problems needs to solve an n × n linear system as follows: it is a linear system that was originally tridiagonal, but a physical condition needs to be imposed, which needs to replace either the ﬁrst equation or the last equation, and it looks as follows: α1x1 + α2x2 + · · · + αnxn = 1, where αi ̸= 0, i = 1, . . . , n. The values of αi can be changed accord- ing to whether the ﬁrst equation is modiﬁed or the last equation is modiﬁed, and either way the modiﬁed matrix will be diagonally domi- nant and no pivoting will be required. The company has approached a student who has recently successfully completed CPSC 302 and asked for their advice on whether they should replace the ﬁrst or the last equation. The value of n is very large, and the company is concerned primarily about computational cost. What would your advice to the company be? 7. State one advantage and one disadvantage that the SOR method for iteratively solving a linear system has over the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods. 8. A stationary iterative scheme for solving a linear system Ax = b can be written in the form xk+1 = xk + M −1rk, k = 0, 1, . . . where rk = b−Axk is the residual at the kth iteration, and M is a ma- trix associated with a splitting of A. The iteration matrix associated with stationary schemes is given by T = I − M −1A. Consider the scheme xk+1 = xk + rk. (a) Write down the iteration matrix corresponding to this scheme. (b) Suppose A is symmetric positive deﬁnite with eigenvalues λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0. State a condition on the eigenvalues of A for the iterative scheme to converge to the solution for any initial guess. Simplify the condition as much as you can, to depend on a minimal number of eigenvalues. 9. The inverse power method for computing an eigenvalue of a given matrix A computes iterates that are based on solving linear systems involving A − µI, where µ is a constant which is desirably close to the eigenvalue we seek to compute. Assume that we have a computer pro- gram to set up and carry out the iterations, and suppose the iterative process has converged within k iterations. Assume that computational eﬃciency is a prime consideration, and we have performed computa- tions as eﬃciently as we could. (a) How many times (at a minimum) throughout the iterative process do we need to compute the LU decomposition of A − µI? (b) How many times do we need to perform backward and forward substitutions? (c) If the matrix is known to be tridiagonal of size n×n and n is large, and it is known that the inverse power iteration has converged within 10 iterations, what is the overall cost of the procedure? You may assume that with respect to the value of n, the number 10 is considered O(1). 10. (a) Show that if Q1 and Q2 are orthogonal matrices, then so is Q1Q2. (b) Suppose A is a square matrix and Q is an orthogonal matrix. Determine whether or not A and QAQT have the same singular values. Justify your answer. (c) Suppose the spectral condition number of a square nonsingular matrix A is known to be κ2(A) = M. Suppose A = QR is the QR decomposition of A. Provide expressions for κ2(Q) and κ2(R) in terms of M and other constants.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
