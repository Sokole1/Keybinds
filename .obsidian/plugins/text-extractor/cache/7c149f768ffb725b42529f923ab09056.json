This is basically a pen-and-paper question, even though you may use the computer to work on it, but please show all your steps. Consider the 3 x 3 matrix 1 -2 1 A=|[5 -1 â€”-5]. 2 -4 4 (a) Find the LU decomposition of A when no pivoting is used. Show all intermediate steps, and express all row operations in terms of matrices. Make sure to show all the matrices that we have defined in class, particularly M) and M2 and the actual factors L and U. (b) Find the LU decomposition of A when partial pivoting is used. Show all your interme- diate steps, and express all row operations in terms of matrices. Similarly to part (a), show all matrices involved, and remember to show also the permutation matrices that you use. That is, show M1, M@ PO PR M N1 (in our notation) and include also the final matrices L, U, and P such that PA = LU. Run the MATLAB command [L,U,P]=1u(A) to confirm that MATLAB produces the same factors.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
