(b) Show that the solution of the linear least-squares problem miny ||b — Ax|| satisfies r=b— Ax = Pb, where P is an orthogonal projector. Express the projector P in terms of A. (c) Give a geometric interpretation for the orthogonal projector P. Figure 6.2 may be helpful here. (d) Let @ and R be the matrices associated with the QR decomposition of A. Express the matrix P in terms of () and R. Simplify your result as much as possible. (e) With r defined as usual as the residual, consider replacing b by b=b+ar for some scalar o. Show that the same solution is obtained to the problem miny ||b — Ax|| regardless of the value of .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
