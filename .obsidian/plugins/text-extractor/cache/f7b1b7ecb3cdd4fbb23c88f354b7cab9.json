[Total 5 marks for this question] Consider the function f@)y=e\"~q, where a is a positive real number. The derivative of f(z) is given by Vi e !, — 1@ =5 This function has a unique positive root, 0 < z* < oo, (there is no need to show it), and suppose we are using Newton’s method to find it. (a) Write down Newton’s method without simplifying it. [1} marks] (b) Simplify the formula, avoiding redundant operations, to make it suitable for an efficient numerical computation. [1; marks] (c) When you run Newton’s method, MATLAB calls the built-in exp and sqrt functions. Assuming your code is as efficient as possible, what is the number of built-in function calls per iteration (no need to justify): i. of the exponential function exp; [1 mark] ii. of the square root function sqrt.
