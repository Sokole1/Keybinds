At any given month, each city is either experiencing an outbreak (state 1) or not experiencing an outbreak (state 0). The following events can happen independently: o A city in state 0 can spontaneously experience outbreaks with probability 1/8. This causes the city to be in state 1 next month. o A city in state 1 can infect the other city with probability 1/2. This causes the other city to be state 1 next month. o A city in state 1 can resolve their outbreak with probability 1/2. This causes that city to be in state 0 next month, unless the other city also infects it. (a) (1 point) Explain how to represent the state of the world as a Markov chain with state space {0,1}2. Explain why it is a Markov chain. (b) (4 points) Write down the transition probability matrix for this Markov chain. Arrange the rows and columns in the following order: 00, 01, 10, 11. (c) (2 points) Which states, if any, are absorbing states? Which states if any are periodic? Is the chain ergodic? (d) (6 points) Suppose the world starts in state 01. What is the expected number of months before returning to this state? Explain your reasoning. (e) (2 points) Suppose the world starts in state 01. Let H, = â€” Y _7\"(s)log 7\" (s) denote the entropy of the world state after n months (here 7\"(s) is the probability of finding the world in state s after n months). Does H,, increase monotonically with n? Explain your reasoning.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
