To find those two values of t, we observe that o the first component of r(¢), namely ¢2, matches the first component of (0, 3,0), namely 0, only when ¢ = 0. So we would guess that the ¢ corresponding to (0,3,0) ist = 0. Asr(0) = (0,3, 20°%) = (0, 3,0), this is indeed the case. « The first component of r(t), namely 2, matches the first component of (1,3,—1/3), namely 1, only when ¢ = +1. For the third component of r(t), namely 33, to match the third component of (1,3, —1/3), namely —1/3, we need t < 0. So we would guess that the ¢ corresponding to (1,3,—1/3) ist = —1. To check that this is indeed the case, we compute r(C1) = ((-1)2,3, 3 (1)) = (1,3,-1/3).
