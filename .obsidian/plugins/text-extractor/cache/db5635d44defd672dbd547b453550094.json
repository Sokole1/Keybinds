Velocity g . _— L= - . The velocity V (£) is the first derivative of the position T’ () with respect to time: d \" N = V(t) = = (a costz + asintj + ctk) . Differentiating term by term, we get: V(t) = —asinti + acostj + ck. Speed The speed |V>(t)| is the magnitude of the velocity vector, and it can be found using the formula: KA — [pmp———— 7 7 [¥(t)| = v/(—asint)? + (acost)? + c. Simplifying, we get: [V(#)| = 1/a2(sin® ¢ + cos?t) + 2 = Va2 + 2. Note that the speed is constant because it does not depend on ¢. Acceleration The acceleration & () is the first derivative of the velocity ¥ (£) with respect to time: - d S s T O = (*(zsmtl +acosty + Ek) . Differentiating term by term, we get: A(t) = —acosti — asintj + Ok. Path of the Particle To describe the path of the particle, let's ook at its position vector ?(t) = acostt + asintj + ctk. The & and y components are a cos t and a sin ¢, respectively. These describe a circle in the xy-plane with a radius a. The z-component, ct, is linear in £, which means the particle moves along the z-axis at a constant rate. Therefore, the particle's path is a helix spiraling around the z-axis. The radius of the helix is a, and the pitch (distance between successive turns) is determined by the constant c.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
