Consider the initial value problem (I.V.P.):    dy dx = cot(y) y(0) = y0 ∈ (0, π) . Note: cot(x) = 1 tan(x) . (a) Find all critical points on the interval (0, π) and determine their stability. (b) Determine the long term behavior of the solution to the I.V.P. without solving it. (c) Determine the implicit solution to the I.V.P. by transforming the ODE into an exact equa- tion. (d) Is the implicit solution coherent with the answer to question (b)? Explain. Answer. (a) The critical points are solution to cot(y) = 0 for y ∈ (0, π). There is only one critical point on that interval: y = π 2 . Since cot(y) ≥ 0 for y ∈ (0, π 2 ] and cot(y) ≤ 0 for y ∈ [ π 2 , π), the critical point π 2 is stable. (b) For y0 ∈ (0, π), since π 2 is the only (stable) critical point, we have: lim x→∞ y(x) = π 2 . (c) The ODE can be rewritten as cos(y) − sin(y) dy dx = 0. We then deﬁne: { M (x, y) = cos(y) N (x, y) = − sin(y), and check if the equation is exact. Since ∂M ∂y = − sin(y) ̸= ∂N ∂x = 0, the equation is not exact. We then look for an integrating factor u(x, y). We ﬁrst compute My−Nx N = − sin(y)−0 − sin(y) = 1. The integrating factor is therefore solution to: ux = u(x) ↔ u(x) = e x. The general implicit solution to the ODE is then: ex cos(y) = C, C an arbitrary constant. Using the initial condition, we ﬁnd C = cos(y0). Therefore the implicit solution to the ODE is: cos(y) = cos(y0)e−x. 1 (d) We have: lim x→∞ cos(y) = lim x→∞ e −x cos(y0) = 0 ∀y0 ∈ (0, π) . Therefore lim x→∞ y = π 2 . 2. Consider Euler’s equation for x > 0: ax2y′′ + bxy′ + cy = 0, a ̸= 0. Suppose that (b − a)2 − 4ac = 0. (a) Find a ﬁrst solution y1(x) of Euler’s equation of the form xr, r a real number (b) Using the method of reduction of order, ﬁnd a second solution y2(x), linearly independent of y1(x). (c) Express the general solution to Euler’s equation when (b − a)2 − 4ac = 0. Answer. (a) We look for a solution to the form y1(x) = xr. We inject this expression in the ODE and obtain ar2 +(b−a)r+c = 0. Since (b−a)2 −4ac = 0, we have a double root r1 = r2 = − b−a 2a . We then obtain a ﬁrst solution: y1(x) = x− b−a 2a . (b) We now use the method of reduction of order to compute a second solution linearly inde- pendent of y1(x). We ﬁrst rewrite the ODE as: y′′ + b ax y′ + c ax2 y = 0, a ̸= 0, and identify p(x) = b ax . We now compute y2(x) as: y2(x) = y1(x) ∫ e− ∫ p(x) dx y2 1(x) dx. We ﬁrst have, for x > 0, e− ∫ p(x) dx = e− ∫ b ax dx = C1x− b a and we choose C1 = 1. We then have ∫ e− ∫ p(x) dx y2 1(x) dx = ∫ x− b a x− b−a a dx = log(x) + C2, and we choose C2 = 0. Finally, we obtain: y2(x) = log(x)x− b−a 2a . (c) The functions y1(x) and y2(x) form of basis of the solutions to the ODE. The general solution therefore writes: y(x) = [A + B log(x)] x− b−a 2a . 3. (a) Find the general solution to 2y′′ + 5y′ − 3y = 0. (b) Find the solution to this ODE verifying the following initial conditions: y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 0. Answer. 2 (a) The characteristic equation is 2r2 + 5r − 3 = 0 and b2 − 4ac = 49 > 0. Therefore the characteristic equation has two real roots r1 = −5+7 4 = 1 2 and r2 = − −5−7 4 = −3. The general solution to the ODE is then: y(x) = C1e x 2 + C2e −3x. (b) The initial conditions give the following system:    C1 + C2 = 1 C1 2 − 3C2 = 0. Therefore: C1 = 6 7 and C2 = 1 7 . 4. Consider the ODE: 4y′′ − 4y′ + y = 0. (a) Find a ﬁrst solution y1(x) of the form erx, r a real number. (b) Using the method of reduction of order, ﬁnd a second solution y2(x), linearly independent of y1. (c) Find the solution to this ODE verifying the following initial conditions: y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 2. Answer. (a) The characteristic equation is 4r2 −4r +1 = 0 and b2 −4ac = 0. Therefore the characteristic equation has one double real root r = 4 8 = 1 2 . We then obtain a ﬁrst solution: y1(x) = e x 2 . (b) We now use the method of reduction of order to compute a second solution linearly inde- pendent of y1(x). We ﬁrst rewrite the ODE as: y′′ − y′ + 1 4 y = 0, and identify p(x) = −1. We now compute y2(x) as: y2(x) = y1(x) ∫ e− ∫ p(x) dx y2 1(x) dx. We ﬁrst have, e− ∫ p(x) dx = C1ex and we choose C1 = 1. We then have ∫ e− ∫ p(x) dx y2 1(x) dx = ∫ ex ex dx = x + C2, and we choose C2 = 0. Finally, we obtain: y2(x) = xe x 2 . (c) We write the general solution to the ODE as y(x) = [C1 + C2x] e x 2 . The initial conditions give the following system:    C1 = 1 C2 + C1 2 = 2. Therefore: C1 = 1 and C2 = 3 2 . 3 5. Find the real numbers x and y such that z = x + iy where: (a) z = 2 3−4i , (b) z = e 3−i π 4 . Answer. (a) We multiply the denominator by its complex conjugate: 2 3−4i = 2(3+4i) 9+16 = 6 25 + i 8 25 . (b) We use Euler’s formula: e3−i π 4 = e3 (cos( π 4 ) − sin( π 4 )) = √2 2 e3(1 − i). 6. Let z = 1 + √3i. (a) Find r and θ such that z = reiθ. (b) Express ( z 2 )2019 as a complex number, i.e. z = x + iy. No calculator should be used. Answer. (a) We know that r = √ x2 + y2 = 2 and that tan(θ) = y x = √3 = √3 2 1 2 = sin( π 3 ) cos( π 3 ) , therefore θ = π 3 . (b) ( z 2 )2019 = ( r 2 )2019e i2019 π 3 = ei2019 π 3 . Noticing that 2019 = 3 ∗ 673, we have ( z 2 )2019 = eiπ = −1. 7. Find the solution to the following I.V.P.: { y′′ − 4y′ + 5y = 0 y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 2. Answer. The characteristic equation is r2 − 4r + 5 = 0 with b2 − 4ac = −4 < 0. Therefore the characteristic equation has two complex roots r1 = 2 + i and r2 = 2 − i. The general solution to the ODE is then: y(x) = [C1 cos(t) + C2 sin(t)] e 2t The initial conditions give the following system: { C1 = 1 2C1 + C2 = 2. Therefore: C1 = 1 and C2 = 0. 8. Consider a closed loop electrical circuit formed of capacitor of capacitance C and an inductor of inductance L placed in series. At t = 0, the initial voltage of the inductor is UL(0) = U0, the initial voltage of the capacitor is UC(0) = −U0 and the initial current in the circuit is i(0) = 0. Give an expression of the time-evolution of the voltage of the capacitor UC(t). No undetermined constant of integration should remain. Answer. The governing equation for the current i(t) is: i′′ + ω2 0i = 0, width ω0 = √ 1 LC . 4 We therefore have i(t) = A cos(ω0t) + B sin(ω0t). The initial condition for the current gives A = 0 and therefore i(t) = B sin(ω0t). We then have UL(t) = L di dt . We therefore obtain UL(t) = BLω0 cos(ω0t). Using the initial condition for the voltage of the inductor, we obtain B = U0 Lω0 . Therefore: i(t) = U0 Lω0 sin(ω0t). We then have dUC dt = i C , hence: UC(t) = −U0 cos(ω0t) . Note: we could also solve only for UL and notice that UC = −UL. 5 MATH 215/255 Homework 3M - Solutions Submit online via Canvas by 6pm, Wednesday, October 9, 2019 M1. Consider the following I.V.P.: y′ = cot(y), y(0) = π 6 . (a) Use MATLAB to solve the I.V.P. for 0 ≤ t ≤ 5, using both Euler’s method and the improved Euler’s method. For each method, use the following step sizes h = 1, 0.5, 0.25. Plot the results in two separate ﬁgures, one for each method. (b) Use MATLAB to solve exactly the I.V.P. and plot the exact solution in each of the two previous ﬁgures. (c) Include a title and a legend. Save the ﬁgures as H3M1-Euler.fig and H3M1-Improved-Euler.fig. Hint: You may use the function euler provided in the ﬁle euler.m. You can also create a ﬁle improved euler.m from the ﬁle euler.m in which you implement the improved Euler’s method. Answer. The solution to the I.V.P. is given by: y(t) = arccos( √3 2 e−t). In the ﬁgure we see that the error is essentially decreasing by half when we halve the step size for Euler’s method, and by 4 for the improved Euler’s method. 6","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
