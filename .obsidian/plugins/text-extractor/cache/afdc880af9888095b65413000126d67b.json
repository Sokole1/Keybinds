Let S be the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = a2 for a ﬁxed constant a > 0 oriented outward. Suppose that we parametrize S by using the spherical coordinate: ⃗r (ϕ, θ) = ⟨a sin ϕ cos θ, a sin ϕ sin θ, a cos ϕ⟩, 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. (a) Show that ∂ϕ⃗r × ∂θ⃗r (ϕ, θ) = a sin ϕ⃗r (ϕ, θ). (b) Using the parametrization, verify that the area of S is 4πa 2. (c) Compute the ﬂux of ⃗F(x, y, z) = ⟨x, y, 0⟩ across S by using the result from (a). (d) Compute the ﬂux of ⃗F(x, y, z) = ⟨x, y, 0⟩ across S by using the divergence theorem. 2. Exercise 16.7: 6, 7, 11, 12 from the following website: https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus_online/section16.07.html For the above exercises, do not use the divergence theorem. 3. Do the exercise 16.7.12 again, now using the divergence theorem. 4. Exercise 16.9: 2, 5, 7, 8 from the following website: https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus_online/section16.09.html 5. Let S be the part of the cylinder x2 + y2 = 4 between the planes z = 0 and z = 5, oriented so that the normal vector at (2, 0, 1) is ⟨1, 0, 0⟩. Compute the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y, z) = ⟨xy2, y3, 4x2z⟩ across the oriented surface S. Page 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
