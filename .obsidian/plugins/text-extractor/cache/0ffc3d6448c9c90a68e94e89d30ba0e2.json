The annual rainfall is a normal random variable with mean p = 1000 mm and standard deviation o = 100 mm. Assume that the rainfall in different years is independent. (a) (2 marks) Find the probability that there is more than 1250 of rain in a year. (b) (2 marks) Among years with rainfall over 1100 mm, what proportion have rainfall exceeding 1250 mm? (c) (2 marks) Let X be the first year (starting on January 1 of year 1) that the rainfall exceeds 1250 mm. What is the distribution of X (name and any parameters)? (d) (2 marks) Let Y be the number of years that the rainfall exceeds 1250 mm, out of the first ten years. What is the distribution of Â¥ (name and any parameters)?
