Consider a damped forced system mu ′′ + cu ′ + ku = F0 cos(ωt) where ω is the forcing frequency. Using analytical methods, we ﬁnd the steady state response of the system is uss(t) = F0 m√ (2ωp)2 + (ω2 0 − ω2)2 cos(ωt − γ) where p = c 2m , ω0 = √ k m , γ = arctan ( 2ωp ω2 0 − ω2 ) (a) Let m = 4, c = 1, k = 8 and F0 = 8. Use MATLAB to plot the amplitude A of the steady state response versus ω for 0 ≤ ω ≤ 5. Save the ﬁgure as amplitude.fig. (b) With the same parameters, use MATLAB to plot the phase shift γ of the steady state response versus ω for 0 ≤ ω ≤ 5. Save the ﬁgure as phase.fig. (Hint: Use the MATLAB function atan2.) (c) Estimate the maximum value of A and the frequency ω for which it occurs. Save the values as Amax and wmax respectively. M2. Consider an undamped mass-spring system where m = 2, k = 10, and c = 0 and with forcing function F (t) = cos(2.5t) 2x ′′(t) + 10x(t) = cos(2.5t) , x(0) = x′(0) = 0 . (a) Plot the solution x(t) (see Lebl 2.6.1) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 100. Save the ﬁgure as beats.fig. (b) Experiment with diﬀerent values for the forcing frequency ω in F (t) = cos(ωt). Find the maximum range of values (to 2 decimal places) such that the maximum amplitude |x(t)| exceeds 1. Save the interval as a vector of length 2 called interval. For example, if ω ∈ [2.12, 3.77] then save interval = [2.12 3.77]. (Note. It may be helpful to use a for loop and max function.)
