Let C be the curve of intersection of the surfaces z = x + y and z = x2 + y2. Compute∫ C F · dr for (a) F = (x2, y2, 3e z) (b) F = (y2, x 2, 3e z) Solution. (a) For F = (x2, y2, 3ez), we have ∇ × F = 0. Therefore, since F is deﬁned on all of R 3 (which is simply-connected), then F is conser- vative by the second main theorem of conservative vector ﬁelds. The curve C satisﬁes the equation x + y = x2 + y2, z = x + y. The equation for x, y is x2 − x + y2 − y = 0 and completing the square gives (x − (1/2)) 2 + (y − (1/2)) 2 = (1/2), so in the xy plane, the curve C is a circle of radius 1/ √2 centered at (1/2, 1/2). This is a closed curve, so ∫ C F · dr = 0 since F is conservative. (b) For F = (y2, x 2, 3e z), we note that (0, 0, 3e z) = ∇ϕ where ϕ = 3e z. So F = (y2, x 2, 0) + ∇ϕ. Therefore ∫ C F · dr = ∫ C(y2, x 2, 0) · dr. We calculated above that the equation for C is (x − (1/2)) 2 + (y − (1/2)) 2 = (1/2), so we parametrize C by x(t) = (1/2) + 2−1/2 cos t, y(t) = (1/2) + 2−1/2 sin t. The line integral becomes ∫ C F · dr = ∫ 2π 0 ((1/2 + 2−1/2 sin t) 2, (1/2 + 2−1/2 cos t)2) · (−2 −1/2 sin t, 2 −1/2 cos t)dt This integral is ∫ 2π 0 − 1 √2(1/2 + 2−1/2 sin t) 2 sin t dt + 1 √2(1/2 + 2−1/2 cos t) 2 cos t dt Page 1 Math 317 Quiz 3 Practice Problems We can expand this out, but recall that ∫ 2π 0 sin tdt = 0, ∫ 2π 0 sin3 tdt = 0, ∫ 2π 0 cos tdt = 0, ∫ 2π 0 cos 3 tdt = 0, so the only non-zero integrals are ∫ 2π 0 − 1 √ 2 (2)(1/2)(2 −1/2)(sin t) sin t dt + 1 √2(2)(1/2)(2 −1/2)(cos t) cos t dt which is 1 2 ∫ 2π 0 (− sin2 t + cos2 t)dt = 0 since ∫ 2π 0 sin 2 t dt = ∫ 2π 0 cos 2 t dt = π. So ∫ C F · dr = 0. 2. Let R be the region in the ﬁrst quadrant of the xy-plane bounded by the coordinate axes and y = 1 − x2. Recall that ds = ds dt dt and ds dt = |v|. (a) Evaluate ∫ ∂R xds. (b) Evaluate ∫ ∂R F · dr for F = (sin(x2) − xy)i + (x2 + cos y2)j. Solution. (a) Let C be the curve y = 1 − x2 from (1, 0) to (0, 1). Let L1 be the straight line from (0, 1) to (0, 0) Let L2 be the straight line from (0, 0) to (1, 0). Then the question is asking for ∫ C xds + ∫ L1 xds + ∫ L2 xds. First, we compute ∫ C xds = ∫ 0 −1 x(t)((dx dt ) 2 + ( dy dt )2) 1/2dt using the parametrization x(t) = −t, y(t) = 1 − t 2, −1 ≤ t ≤ 0. (This curve starts r(−1) = (1, 0) and ends at r(0) = (0, 1) as required) This is ∫ C xds = ∫ 0 −1(−t)(1 + 4t 2)1/2dt = − \f \f \f \f 0 −1(1 + 4t 2) 3/2(2/3)(1/4)(1/2) = (1/12)(5 3/2 − 1). Next, ∫ L1 xds = 0 Page 2 Math 317 Quiz 3 Practice Problems since x(t) = 0 along L1. Finally, for L2, we parametrize it by x(t) = t, y(t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, which gives ∫ L1 xds = ∫ 1 0 tdt = (1/2). In total ∫ ∂R xds = (1/2) + (1/12)(5 3/2 − 1). (b) We will use Green’s theorem, so we start with (2DcurlF) = [ ∂x ∂y sin x2 − xy x2 + cos y2 ] = 2x − −x = 3x. Therefore ∫ ∂R F · dr = ∫ ∫ R 3xdA. The double integral is ∫ ∫ R 3xdA = 3 ∫ 1 0 ∫ y=1−x2 y=0 xdydx which is 3 ∫ 1 0 x(1 − x2)dx = 3 ∫ 1 0 (x − x3)dx = 3 \f \f \f \f 1 0 x2 2 − x4 4 = 3 4. 3. Let F = (x + 3y)i + (x + y)j and G = (x + y)i + (2x − 3y)j. Find the number A such that for each circle C in the plane, then ∫ C F · dr = A ∫ C G · dr. Solution. We need to solve A such that ∫ C(F − AG) · dr = 0 for all closed curves C. This means we are looking for A such that F − AG is a con- servative vector ﬁeld. Since F, G are deﬁned on all of R 2 (which is simply-connected), the second main theorem applies, and we need to ﬁnd A such that 2D curl(F − AG) = 0. We compute 2D curl(F − AG) = [ ∂x ∂y x + 3y − Ax − Ay x + y − 2Ax + 3Ay ] which becomes 1 − 2A − 3 + A. Setting this to zero, we obtain −2 − A = 0 which implies A = −2.

We parametrize the curve by x(t) = (cos t)3, y(t) = (sin t)3, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π so that x(t) 2/3 + y(t) 2/3 = cos 2 t + sin2 t = 1. Then ∫ ∂R 1 2 (−ydx + xdy) = 1 2 ∫ 2π 0 (− sin 3 t)(3 cos 2 t)(− sin t)dt + (cos3 t)(3 sin t) 2(cos t)dt This integral is 3 2 ∫ 2π 0 (sin 4 t)(cos 2 t)dt + (cos4 t)(sin t) 2dt = 3 2 ∫ 2π 0 (sin 2 t)(cos 2 t)(sin 2 t + cos2 t)dt so we need to integrate 3 2 ∫ 2π 0 sin 2 t cos 2 tdt. We use the trig identity sin 2t = 2 sin t cos t. The integral becomes 3 8 ∫ 2π 0 (sin 2t) 2dt = 3 8 ∫ 2π 0 1 2 (1 − (cos 4t))dt using (sin θ)2 = (1/2)(1 − cos 2θ). This integral can be now be evaluated, so ∫ ∫ R dA = 3 16 \f \f \f \f 2π 0 (t − 1 4(sin 4t)) = 3π 8 . 5. Evaluate the line integral ∫ C(x2 + ye x)dx + (x cos y + e x)dy where C is the arc of the curve x = cos y for −π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, traversed in the direction of increasing y. Solution. Let F = (x2 + ye x, x cos y + e x). The arc C is not a loop, so we must close the loop to apply Green’s theorem. Let L be the straight line from (0, π/2) to (0, −π/2). Then ∫ C+L F · dr = ∫ ∫ R(2D curlF)dA. We compute 2D curlF = [ ∂x ∂y x2 + ye x x cos y + e x ] = cos y. Page 4 Math 317 Quiz 3 Practice Problems Then ∫ ∫ R(2D curlF)dA = ∫ π/2 −π/2 ∫ x=cos y x=0 (cos y)dxdy. This double integral becomes ∫ π/2 −π/2(cos y)2dy = 1 2 ∫ π/2 −π/2(1 + cos 2y)dy using cos2 θ = (1/2)(1 + cos 2θ). This evaluates to \f \f \f \f π/2 −π/2 y 2 + 1 4 sin(2y) = π 2 . Back to the problem at hand, we have the identity ∫ C F · dr + ∫ L F · dr = π 2 so it remains to compute the line integral on L. This is parametrized by r(t) = (0, π/2) + t(0, −π), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. So x(t) = 0, y(t) = π/2 − tπ, and ∫ L F · dr = ∫ 1 0 (π/2 − tπ, 1) · (0, −π)dt = −π. Our ﬁnal answer is then ∫ C F · dr = π 2 + π. Page 5","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
