We will call the graph G a path if its nodes can be written as v1, v, ..., Up with an edge between v; and v; if and only if the numbers Â¢ and j differ by exactly 1. With each node v;, we associate a positive integer weight w;. For example, in the following path, the weights are the numbers drawn inside the nodes. vl V2 V3 vd Vi ve Consider the problem of finding the subset of the vertices V of G with the largest total weight, subject to the following condition: If a node v; with weight w; is chosen as part of the subset, then none of the nodes v;_1, v;_g, ..., Vi, can be chosen. For instance, if we choose v as part of the subset for the graph G in the picture, then we are not allowed to include vz and vy (because the weight of vy is 2). This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let @; be the weight of the subset of {v1,v2,...,v;} with the largest total weight, subject to the constraint above.
