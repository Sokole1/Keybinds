(a) Consider the parametrized space curve r(t) = (cos(t), sin(t), t 2) Find a parametric form for the tangent line at the point corresponding to t = π. (b) Find the tangential component aT (t) of acceleration, as a function of t, for the parametrized space curve of (a). 2. (a) Let r(t) = (2 sin3 t, 2 cos 3 t, 3 sin t cos t) Find the unit tangent vector to this parametrized curve at t = π/3, pointing in the direction of increasing t. (b) Reparametrize the vector function r(t) from (a) with respect to arc length measured from the point t = 0 in the direction of increasing t. 3. (a) Consider the vector ﬁeld F = (3y, x − 1) in R2 . Compute the line integral ∫ L F · dr where L is the line segment from (1, 1) to (2, 2). (b) Find an oriented path C from (2, 2) to (1, 1) such that ∫ C F · dr = 4 where F is the vector ﬁeld from (a). 4. (a) Find the curl of the vector ﬁeld F = ( 2 + x2 + z , 0 , 3 + x2z). (b) Let C be the curve in R3 from the point (0, 0, 0) to the point (2, 0, 0), consisting of three consecutive line segments connecting the points (0, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 3), (0, 0, 3) to (0, 1, 0), and (0, 1, 0) to (2, 0, 0). Evaluate the line integral ∫ C F · dr where F is the vector ﬁeld from (a). 5. (a) Consider the surface S given by the equation x2 + z2 = cos 2 y Find an equation for the tangent plane to S at the point ( 1 2, π 4 , 1 2) . 1 (b) Compute the integral ∫ ∫ S sin y dS where S is the part of the surface from (a) lying between the planes y = 0 and y = 1 2π. 6. (a) Let S be the bucket shaped surface consisting of the cylindrical surface y2 + z2 = 9 between x = 0 and x = 5, and the disc inside the yz–plane of radius 3 centered at the origin. (The bucket S has a bottom, but no lid.) Orient S in such a way that the unit normal points outward. Compute the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld ∇∇∇ × G through S, where G = (x, −z, y). (b) Compute the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld F = (2 + z, xz2, x cos y) through S, where S is as in (a). 7. (a) Find the divergence of the vector ﬁeld F = (z + sin y, zy, sin x cos y). (b) Find the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld F of (a) through the sphere of radius 3 centred at the origin in R 3 . 8. True or false? (a) ∇∇∇ × (a × r) = 0, where a is a constant vector in R 3 , and r is the vector ﬁeld r = (x, y, z). (b) ∇∇∇ · (∇∇∇f ) = 0 for all scalar ﬁelds f on R 3 with continuous second partial derivatives. (c) ∇∇∇(∇∇∇·F) = 0 for every vector ﬁeld F on R 3 with continuous second partial derivatives. (d) Suppose F is a vector ﬁeld with continuous partial derivatives in the region D, where D is R3 without the origin. If ∇∇∇ · F = 0, then the ﬂux of F through the sphere of radius 5 with center at the origin is 0. (e) Suppose F is a vector ﬁeld with continuous partial derivatives in the region D, where D is R 3 without the origin. If ∇∇∇ × F = 0 then ∮ C F · dr is zero, for every simple and smooth closed curve C in R 3 which avoids the origin. (f) If a vector ﬁeld F is deﬁned and has continuous partial derivatives everywhere in R 3, and it satisﬁes ∇∇∇ · F > 0, everywhere, then, for every sphere, the ﬂux out of one hemisphere is larger than the ﬂux into the opposite hemisphere. (g) If r(t) is a path in R 3 with constant curvature κ, then r(t) parametrizes part of a circle of radius 1/κ. (h) The vector ﬁeld F = (− y x2+y2 , x x2+y2 , z) is conservative in its domain, which is R 3, without the z–axis. (i) If all ﬂow lines of a vector ﬁeld in R 3 are parallel to the z–axis, then the circulation of the vector ﬁeld around every closed curve is 0. (j) If the speed of a moving particle is constant, then its acceleration is orthogonal to its velocity. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
