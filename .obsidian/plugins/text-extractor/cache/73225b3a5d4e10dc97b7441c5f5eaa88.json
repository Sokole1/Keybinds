Differentiate both sides: u, = X(2) - T(t) Ugy = X”(x) : T(t) Then substituting into the original to get: X(x)-T(t) = X\" (z) - T(t) Dividing by o2X (z)T(t): % = % = X for some constant A since both sides depend on different variables, they must equal a constant. Solve for time: T _ A a?T(t) — T(t) = A\\a2T(t). Solving gives: T(t) = Ce***t for some constant C Solve space equation: X\" (xz) = AX(x). Given initial conditions: X(0) =0 = X(L). X =0 is a trivial solution. Find nontrivial solution which depends on A. Case 1. A > 0. Let A = p? so: X\" —u?X = 0= X(z) = Asinh(uz) + Bcosh(uz)","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
