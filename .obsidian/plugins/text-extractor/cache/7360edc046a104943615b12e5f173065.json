For two nodes z and y let the (z,y)-edge load of an edge e in the graph, which we’ll denote by load(z, y, €), be the number of shortest paths between z and y that pass through e. Let load(e) be the sum of load(z, y, €), taken over all pairs of nodes (z,y). Example: Consider the following graph: o If e = (2,3), then load(1, 8, e) = 1, since the only shortest path from 1 to 8 that goes via edge (2,3), is the path 1,2,3,8. e If e = (1,6) then load(1,7,e) = 2, with the two paths being 1,6,3,7 and 1,6,4,7. o If e = (2,3) then load(1, 4, e) = 0, since no shortest path from 1 to 4 goes through edge (2, 3). 1.
