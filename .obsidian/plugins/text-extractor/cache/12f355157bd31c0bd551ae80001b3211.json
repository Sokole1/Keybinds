For IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point arithmetic, the base 7 is 2, and t is 53 (1implicit leading bit + 52 explicitly stored bits). The machine epsilon is 2752 whichis approximately 2.22 x 10716, For IEEE 754 single-precision, [7 is 2, and t is 24 (1implicit leading bit + 23 explicitly stored bits). The machine epsilon is 2%, which is approximately 1.19 x 1077, The machine epsilon gives you an idea of the smallest relative error you can expect from a single floating-point operation due to rounding. Keep in mind that errors can accumulate when you perform a sequence of operations.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
