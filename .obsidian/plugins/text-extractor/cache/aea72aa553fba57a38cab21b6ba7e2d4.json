Only your ﬁnal answer is required here, and there will be no partial credit. (a) Suppose a particle r(t) travels at constant speed |v(t)| = 1 along a curve C with curvature κ(t) = 1 + t 2. Compute the norm of the acceleration |a| at t = 1. Solution. The formula for the decomposition of acceleration is a = d dt |v|T + |v| 2κN, so in this case a = (1) 2(1 + t2)N and so |a(1)| = |1 + 12||N| = 2 since N is a unit vector (|N| = 1). |a|(1) = 2. (b) True or False. Suppose F is a vector ﬁeld and C is a closed curve such that∫ C F · dr = 1. Then F cannot be a conservative vector ﬁeld. Solution. True. If F is conservative, then ∫ C F · dr = ϕ(P2) − ϕ(P1) where P1, P2 are the start and end points of the curve. If C is a closed curve, then the start and end points are the same. So ∫ C F · dr = ϕ(P ) − ϕ(P ) = 0. Hence if there’s a closed curve C where the integral is not zero, then F is cannot be conservative. (c) Let r(t) be a parametrized curve with corresponding moving frame { ˆT, ˆN, ˆB}. Compute d ˆT dt × ˆN. Solution. Since ˆN = dT dt /| dT dt |, then d ˆT dt × ˆN = \f \f \f \f dT dt \f \f \f \f ˆN × ˆN = 0. (d) True or False. If C is a smooth simple closed curve lying in the region {(x, y) ∈ R2 such that x < 1 and (x, y) ̸= (0, 0)} then ∫ C − y x2 + y2 dx + x x2 + y2 dy = 0. Solution. False. We did something very similar in-class. Enclose the singularity by a small circle, for example x2 + y2 = (1/4) parametrized by x(t) = (1/2) cos t, y(t) = (1/2) sin t, ˙x = −(1/2) sin t, ˙y = (1/2) cos t. Using x2 + y2 = (1/4), the line integral around this circle is ∫ 2π 0 (1/4) (1/4) [ (− sin t)(− sin t)dt + (cos t)(cos t) ]dt which is ∫ 2π 0 dt = 2π ̸= 0. Page 1 Math 317 Practice Midterm Solutions 2. Consider the curve parametrized by r(t) = ⟨t + sin t, t − sin t, √ 2 cos t⟩, −∞ < t < ∞. Compute the curvature κ and the torsion τ of the curve at the point (0, 0, √2). Solution. Note that r(0) = (0, 0, √2). We calculate v(t) = (1 + cos t, 1 − cos t, − √2 sin t) and a(t) = (− sin t, sin t, − √2 cos t). Therefore v(0) = (2, 0, 0), a(0) = (0, 0, −√ 2), and v(0) × a(0) = \f \f \f \f  i j k 2 0 0 0 0 − √2   \f \f \f \f = (0, 2 √2, 0). At t = 0, the curvature is κ = |v × a| |v|3 = 2 √2 23 = √2 4 . For the torsion, we will need da dt = (− cos t, cos t, √ 2 sin t), da dt (0) = (−1, 1, 0). The torsion is τ (0) = 1 |v × a|2 (v × a) · da dt = 1 (4)(2)(2 √2) = √2 4 . 3. Let F be a vector ﬁeld on R 3 given by F = ⟨y2e x + ze x, 2ye x + z2, e x + 2yz⟩. (a) Find a potential of F or show that none exists. (b) Let Lλ be the straight line from (0, 0, 0) to (0, 1, −λ). Find the value of λ which minimizes the work function f (λ) = ∫ Lλ F · dr. Solution. We must solve ∂1ϕ = y2e x + ze x, ∂2ϕ = 2ye x + z2, ∂3ϕ = e x + 2yz. From ∂1ϕ = y2ex + ze x, we have ϕ = y2ex + zex + f (y, z). Page 2 Math 317 Practice Midterm Solutions Diﬀerentiating this gives ∂2ϕ = 2ye x + ∂yf . Comparing with ∂2ϕ = 2ye x + z2, we conclude ∂yf = z2. Therefore f (y, z) = yz2 + g(z), and so ϕ = y2ex + zex + yz2 + g(z). Diﬀerentiating this gives ∂3ϕ = e x + 2yz + g′(z). Comparing with ∂3ϕ = ex + 2yz, we conclude g′(z) = 0, and so we may take g = 0. Therefore ϕ = y2e x + ze x + yz2 is a potential. We can then calculate ∫ Lλ F · dr = ϕ(0, 1, −λ) − ϕ(0, 0, 0) = 1 − λ + λ2. The function f (λ) = 1 − λ + λ 2 is an upwards parabola, which is minimized when f ′(λ) = −1 + 2λ = 0, which is at λ = 1 2. 4. Let C be the curve in R 2 consisting of 3 line segments from (1, 0) to (1, 1), from (1, 1) to (0, 2), and from (0, 2) to (0, 0). Compute the line integral ∫ C F · dr for the vector ﬁeld F(x, y) = ⟨−3xy + e x, sin y⟩. Solution. To use Green’s theorem, we must close the loop and introduce the new curve L which is the straight line from (0, 0) to (1, 0). Then if R is the interior region, Green’s theorem gives∫ C F · dr + ∫ L F · dr = ∫ ∫ R(2D curl F)dA. We start with the double integral. 2D curl F = \f \f \f \f [ ∂x ∂y −3xy + ex sin y ] \f \f \f \f = 3x. The upper part of the region follows the line between (0, 2) and (1, 1) which has the equation y = −x + 2. Then we must compute ∫ ∫ R(2D curl F)dA = ∫ 1 0 ∫ −x+2 0 3xdydx = ∫ 1 0 3x(−x + 2)dx = \f \f \f \f 1 0 − x3 + 3x2 = 2. Next we need to compute the new curve L, which is parametrized by r(t) = (t, 0) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. The line integral is ∫ L F · dr = ∫ 1 0 (et, 0) · (1, 0)dt = ∫ 1 0 e tdt = e − 1. Altogether, the required line integral is ∫ C F · dr = ∫ ∫ R(2D curl F)dA − ∫ L F · dr = 2 − (e − 1) = 3 − e. Page 3","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
