Mapping Logical block numbers to Physical block numbers of Hybrid Indexes Consider a file system that represents files using a hybrid index. Assume that it has a blocksize of 2048 and that disk addresses are 8 bytes. In this question, your job is to identify which locations in both the file system metadata and index blocks will need to be read to translate from a logical block number to a physical block number. Assume that all indices start at 0. If we have a hybrid index 12 direct pointers, 1 indirect pointer, 1 double indirect pointer, and 1 triple indirect pointer stored directly in the file metadata structure, indicate the index in each of the metadata, indirect block, double indirect block, and triple indirect block that must be accessed to find the physical block number for the block whose logical block number is 37934. Place a -1 as the answer for any unused block type. For example, the diagram below shows a system with 4-byte block pointers, 16-byte blocks, 2 direct blocks, 1indirect block and 1 double indirect block. On the left, we show a file that has only 2 blocks. In this case, there are no indirect or double indirect pointers, we place a -1 for those answers. If we are interested in LBN 1, then we place a 1in the metadata index answer. On the right, we show a file larger than 6 blocks (i.e., it needs a double indirect block). If we were looking up logical block 4, we would need to reference the indirect block in the file metadata; we use index 2 for that (using the convention that the indirect pointers follow the direct pointers) and then index 2 for the indirect block index; the double indirect block index would be -1as it's not needed to lookup logical block number 4. For logical block number 19, we need the double indirect block (index 3 in the metadata structure). Then, in the double indirect, we need index 3, which references an indirect block in which we need index 1.
