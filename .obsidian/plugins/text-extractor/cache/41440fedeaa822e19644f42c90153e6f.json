In FMP, instead of avoiding instabilities, we want to maximize the number of people who end up with their first choice of partner. (Further, we still require that everyone ends up married.) At the bottom of the page is a full description of the weighted bipartite matching problem. [6 marks] REDUCTION: Given an instance of FMP with n men my,ma, ..., m, and n women wy, wa, ..., Wy, create a weighted bipartite graph, where 1. There are vertices on the left side of the graph and vertices on the right. 2. Each vertex on the left side of the graph v, represents : 3. Each vertex on the right side of the graph vg, represents . 4. There is an edge (vr,, vr;) between each pair of a vertex on the left and a vertex on the right. 5. The weight of edge (vg,,op) it — Now, solve the WBM instance and then produce the FMP instance’s solution by converting each edge (vL;,vR;) in the WBM maximum matching into the married couple . For reference: In the Weighted Bipartite Matching problem, you are given a weighted bipartite graph G = (V4, Vs, E), and you compute a maximal matching E' C E. A matching is a set of edges such that no two edges share a vertex (i.e., no vertex “appears” more than once in the matching), and a mawimal matching is a matching of maximum weight, where the weight of a matching is the sum of the weights of its edges. 0¥ . 2 For example, in the graph to the right, the \\o maximal matching is the edges (A, D) and o (B, E) with a weight of 10 4 10 = 20. 10 \\ % 2) (4","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
