Let Sy = X1 + -+ Xn. Compute the characteristic function of S, and thereby identify its distribution. (b) Four fish are caught in a day. Their weights (in pounds) are independent N(5,4) ran- dom variables (this is an approximation — in reality the weights cannot be negative) Find the probability that the last fish weighs more than the other 3 together. Hint: Consider X1 + X + X — X4 if Xa ~ N(5,4) then what is the distribution of —X,? (¢) Now assume in (a) that s, = p and 0, = o for all i. Let ¥, = n~'S, denote the average of the first n X;’s. Identify the distribution of ¥;, by calculating its characteristic function. Do the same for Z, =n~ Y2 Y1 X;. (d) Show explicitly that the limit, as n — oo, of the characteristic function of ¥, ap- proaches the characteristic function of a constant random variable (as in the proof of the weak law of large numbers). (e) Suppose 42 = 0 and o = 1, so that cach X; is a standard normal random variable Compare the probabilities that [Yy| < 0.1, for n =1, n =5, n = 50 and n = 500.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
