(a) For the gambler’s ruin problem, let M; denote the expected number of games that will be played when Gambler initially has $i (i = 0,1,...,N). Let ¢ = 1 — p.

Hint: Compute the expectation of the number of games X by conditioning on the outcome of the first game: EX = E[X|win first game]P(win first game) + E[X|lose first game] P(lose first game).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
