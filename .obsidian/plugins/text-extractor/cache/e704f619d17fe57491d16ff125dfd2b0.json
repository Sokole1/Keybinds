This function is trivial and Newton’s returns the solution immediately. Secant also returns it immediately but there are two initial guesses and more function evaluations (or a need to simplify), so in this trivial case we just use Newton’s. (This is, admittedly, not a very enlightening example. Newton’s method is superior to the other methods in many other cases. Any time computing te derivative is not computationally costly, we should consider using Newton’s method.) (b) This sawtooth function would give a hard time to both Newton’s and secant methods; indeed its first derivative is not continuous. Bisection, on the other hand, works without a problem, so it’s the method to use here. (c) Since f is smooth, we can use faster methods than bisection. Since f’ is hard to evaluate, we don’t want Newton’s method. This leaves secant as the method of choice.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
