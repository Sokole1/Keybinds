Credit card transactions can be legitimate or fraudulent, and the proportion of fraudulenttransactions is assumed to be one per thousand. Prior to approval, credit card transactionsare tested and classified as legitimate or fraudulent. The test used classifies 99.5% oflegitimate transactions as legitimate, and classifies 99% of fraudulent transactions asfraudulent. a) Determine the probability that a transaction classified as fradulent is in fact fradulentAnswer: 1 1 0 0 0 of being fradulent and 0 . 9 9 are actually fradulent. Then 9 9 9 1 0 0 0 ∗ 0 . 0 0 5 are classified as fradulent but aren’t. So: ( 0 . 0 0 1 ) ( 0 . 9 9 ) ( 0 . 0 0 1 ∗ 0 . 9 9 ) + ( 0 . 9 9 9 ∗ 0 . 0 0 5 ) = 0 . 1 6 5 4 1 3 5 ≈ 0 . 1 6 4 b) The transactions originate in Country A and Country B, and the proportions of fradulenttransactions in these countries are assumed to be respectively one in two thousand (Country A)and one in five hundred (Country B). What fraction of transactions originate in Country A? Answer: Let A be the probability that the transaction comes from country A. Since it either comes from country A or country B, (1 -A) is the probability it comes from country B. So of the 1 1 0 0 0 fradulent transactions, it comes from 1 2 0 0 0 𝐴 and 1 5 0 0 ( 1 − 𝐴 ) . So: 1 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 1 1 0 0 0 = 1 2 0 0 0 𝐴 + 1 5 0 0 ( 1 − 𝐴 ) 1 1 0 0 0 − 1 5 0 0 = ( 1 2 0 0 0 − 1 5 0 0 ) 𝐴 − 0 . 0 0 1 − 0 . 0 0 1 5 = 𝐴 → 𝐴 = 0 . 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 … ≈ 0 . 6 6 7 2. A person’s eye colour is determined by a pair of genes, one of which is inheritedindependently from each parent. Each gene can be blue-eye or brown-eye. A gene inherited from a parent is equally likely to be either of that parent’s two genes. The brown-eye gene is dominant in the sense that if at least one gene is the brown-eye gene then eye colour will bebrown, whereas if both genes are blue-eye genes then eye colour will be blue. Smith and bothhis parents have brown eyes, whereas Smith’s sister has blue eyes. a) What is the probability that Smith possesses the blue-eye gene? b) Smith’s wife has blue eyes. What is the probability that their first child will have blue eyes? 2 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 c) If their first child has brown eyes, what is the probability that their second child will also have brown eyes? Answer: From the punnet square above, Smith could still be either BB or Bb given the first kid has brown eyes. The odds for the second kid do not change. So using the punnet squareabove, the probability the second kid has brown eyes is 68 = 34 3. Suppose that the events 𝐸 1 , 𝐸 2 , 𝐸 3 are independent. Show that 𝑝 ( 𝐸 1 ∪ 𝐸 2 ∪ 𝐸 3 ) = 1 − ∏ 3 𝑖 = 1 [ 1 − 𝑃 ( 𝐸 𝑖 ) ] (1) 3 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 4. Two teams play a series of games, each of which is won by Team A with probability 𝑝 and by Team B with probability 1 − 𝑝 . The winner of the series is the first team to win 5 games. Find the probability that a total of 9 games are played, and that this probability is a maximum when 𝑝 = 12 . 4 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 5 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 5. A true-false question is posed to a team with two members. Each team memberindependently gives the correct the correct answer with probability 𝑝 . a) Which of the following is the better strategy for the team?i. Choose one team member at random and let that member answer the question. ii. Have each member decide his or her answer. If the answers agree, that is the team’s answer. If they disagree, they flip a fair coin and answer “true” if the result is Heads, and answer “false”if Tails. 6 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 6. a) In Python, simulate 100,000 geometric random variables with parameter 𝑝 = 0 . 0 1 and create a histogram of the resulting values, with buckets for each of the values 1 to 1000. # Docs: https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.geometric.html import numpy as np import matplotlib . pyplot as plt p = 0 . 01 trials = 100000 result = np . random . geometric ( p , trials ) x_axis = [ i for i in range ( 1 , 1001 ) ] plt . hist ( result , bins = x_axis ) plt . title ( \" 6 a) \" ) plt . ylabel ( f \" X ~Geom( { p } ) \" ) plt . legend ( ) plt . show ( ) 7 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 b) Next, create a plot of the probability mass function of the geometric random variable, over the integers 1 to 1000. Briefly describe how this plot compares to the histogram from part (a). Answer: part (a) has the same trend as the pmf which makes sense as we drew random samples from the pmf to get our graph for (a). pmf_i = [ ( 1 - p ) * * ( i - 1 ) * p for i in x_axis ] plt . plot ( x_axis , pmf_i ) plt . title ( f \" 6 b) \" ) plt . xlabel ( f \" i \" ) plt . ylabel ( f \" P(X=i) \" ) 8 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 c) Finally, plot the function 𝑓 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑒 − 𝑡 for 𝑡 between 0 and 10. Briefly compare this plot to the two plots above. Answer: The trend is the same as the above where it’s an inverse exponential. It’s less smooth since we only used t between 0 and 10, but it follows that the probability is highest in the beginning then drops off rapidly. import math ts = [ x for x in range ( 1 , 11 ) ] f_t = [ math . exp ( - t ) for t in ts ] plt . plot ( ts , f_t ) plt . title ( f \" 6 c) \" ) plt . xlabel ( f \" t \" ) plt . ylabel ( f \" f(t) = e^(-t) \" ) 9 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 2 77253938 Submit your code, plots, and your written answers to the questions in (b) and (c). Dependingon your computer, the plots may take a couple of minutes to appear. 10","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
