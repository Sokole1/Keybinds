Our goal in this question is to solve a linear system with one million unknowns, arising from the discretization of a differential equation. Consider the differential equation —v\"(z) + ov'(z) = g(z) on the interval (0, 1), with boundary conditions, v(0) = v(1) = 0. Here o is a positive scalar. The function g(z) is known, and our goal is to discretize the problem and compute a numerical solution approximating the values of v(z) on a uniform grid with n gridpoints and gridsize h = ;. We will denote the corresponding n x n matrix by A and the linear system by Av=g. (a) Use centered differences for approximating the second derivatives and the first derivative For the second derivative, use the approximation v(z+ h) — 20(z) + v(z — h) V(o) SEEH R TR For the first derivative, use the approximation h) — —h ()~ v+ )Zhv(r ). There is no need to prove that these are valid (second-order) approximations. Denote ah B=- Show that the matrix is tridiagonal and it has one distinct value per diagonal, as follows: All entries along the main diagonal are equal to 7% o All entries along the superdiagonal immediately above the diagonal are =2 o All entries along the subdiagonal immediately below the diagonal are =172 o All other entries of the matrix are equal to zero","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
