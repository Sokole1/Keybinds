Problem 3 (7 marks) Consider a mass-spring system with damping ma’ + cz' + kz = Fy cos(wt) The steady state response of the system (ie. the particular solution) is ENOEY @ 2] where the amplitude is given by Fy P — m/(2wp)? + (wf —w?)? c I 2wp =% w=1=, y=arctan [ P P =y v (2 If w} — 2p? > 0, then the maximum amplitude occurs when the forcing frequency is w=/uf 2 This is known as the practical resonant frequency. See DiffyQs 2.6.2. Letm = 12, c = 4, k = 80 and F, = 100. Create a Python function called A which takes an input parameter W (which represents the forcing frequency w) and returns the amplitude A. Compute the practical resonant frequency and save the result as wmax .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
