Let ⃗F be a smooth vector ﬁeld deﬁned on R3 such that∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for all closed curves C. Then ∇ × ⃗F = ⃗0. Answer: True Solution: True. The main theorem on conservative vector ﬁelds states that if ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = 0 for all closed curves C, then ⃗F is conser- vative and so ∇ × ⃗F = ⃗0 by the screening test. (b) True or False. Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = (y, 0). Let C be any path from (0, 0) to (1, 0). The line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r does not depend on the choice of path C. Answer: False Solution: False. 2Dcurl ⃗F = −1, so if C1, C2 are two diﬀerent paths from (0, 0) to (1, 0), then by Green’s theorem ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r − ∫ C2 ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫∫ R(−1)dA ̸= 0.

Compute d dt |⃗v| 2 at t = 0. Answer: 20 Solution: d dt |⃗v| 2 = 2⃗a · ⃗v, therefore we must compute 2(3, 2, 1) · (1, 2, 3) = 2(3 + 4 + 3) = 20. (b) Let ⃗r(t) be a curve in R 3 with arclength function s(t) = t 2. Compute the speed |⃗v| at t = 1. Answer: 2 Solution: |⃗v| = ds dt = 2t. Page 4 of 8 3. 10 marks Let ⃗r(t) = (log t, cos t, sin t) be a parametrized curve deﬁned for t > 0. Here log t is the inverse of the exponential function: log et = 1. (a) Compute the curvature κ(t) as a function of t. (b) Compute the limit lim t→∞ κ(t). Solution: We compute ⃗v = (t −1, − sin t, cos t), ⃗a = (−t−2, − cos t, − sin t). The cross-product is ⃗v × ⃗a = (sin 2 t + cos2 t, −(−t −1 sin t − −t −2 cos t), −t −1 cos t − t −2 sin t) which simpliﬁes to ⃗v × ⃗a = (1, t −1 sin t − t −2 cos t, −t −1 cos t − t −2 sin t) The norm is |⃗v × ⃗a| 2 = 1 + (t −1 sin t − t −2 cos t) 2 + (t −1 cos t + t −2 sin t) 2 = 1 + t−2 sin 2 t − 2t −3 sin t cos t + t −4 cos 2 t + t −2 cos 2 t + 2t−3 sin t cos t + t −4 sin 2 t = 1 + t−2 + t−4. Therefore κ = |⃗v × ⃗a| |⃗v|3 = √1 + t−2 + t−4 (t−2 + 1)3/2 . The limit is lim t→∞ κ = 1. Page 5 of 8 4. 10 marks The following vector ﬁeld is conservative in R 3 ⃗F(x, y, z) = (3x2y + z3)ˆi + (x3 − Ayz2)ˆj + (−6y2z + Bxz2 + 2z)ˆk. (a) Find the values of the constants A and B. (b) Find a potential function ϕ such that ⃗F(x, y, z) = ∇ϕ in R 3 and ϕ(1, 1, 1) = 5. (c) For the curve C parametrized by ⃗r(t) = (5 cos t, 4 sin 3t, t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, compute the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r. Solution: The curl is ∇ × ⃗F = \f \f \f \f   ˆi ˆj ˆk ∂x ∂y ∂z 3x2y + z3 x3 − Ayz2 −6y2z + Bxz2 + 2z   \f \f \f \f so ∇ × ⃗F = (−12yz + 2Ayz, −Bz2 + 3z2, 0). Since the vector ﬁeld is conservative, this is equal to the zero vector, and so we must have A = 6, B = 3. To ﬁnd a potential, we must solve ∂1ϕ = 3x2y + z3, ∂2ϕ = x3 − 6yz2, ∂3ϕ = −6y2z + 3xz2 + 2z. From ∂1ϕ = 3x2y + z3, we have ϕ = x3y + xz3 + f (y, z). Diﬀerentiating this gives ∂2ϕ = x3 + ∂yf . Comparing with ∂2ϕ = x3 − 6yz2, we conclude ∂yf = −6yz2. Therefore f (y, z) = −3y2z2 + g(z), and so ϕ = x3y + xz3 − 3y2z2 + g(z). Diﬀerentiating this gives ∂3ϕ = 3xz2 − 6y2z + g′(z). Comparing with ∂3ϕ = −6y2z + 3xz2 + 2z, we conclude g′(z) = 2z, and so g(z) = z2 + C. Therefore ϕ = x3y + xz3 − 3y2z2 + z2 + C Page 6 of 8 is a family of potentials. If ϕ(1, 1, 1) = 5, then ϕ = x3y + xz3 − 3y2z2 + z2 + 5. The line integral from ⃗r(0) = (5, 0, 0) to ⃗r(2π) = (5, 0, 2π) is then ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ϕ(5, 0, 2π) − ϕ(5, 0, 0) = (5)(2π)3 + (2π) 2 = 40π3 + 4π2. Page 7 of 8 5. 10 marks Consider the closed region enclosed by the curves y = (x − 3) 2 and y = 9 − x2. Let C be the boundary and suppose that C is oriented counter-clockwise. (a) Draw the curve C with orientation in the xy plane. (b) Determine the value of ∮ C x2ydx + (4ey + x3)dy. Solution: Let ⃗F = (x2y, 4ey + x3). We start by computing 2D curl ⃗F = ∂x(4ey + x3) − ∂y(x2y) = 3x2 − x2 = 2x2. Let R be the region between the curves. By Green’s theorem, ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ R(2D curl ⃗F) dA = ∫ ∫ R 2x2dydx. The double integral is ∫ ∫ R 2x2dxdy = ∫ 3 0 ∫ 9−x2 (x−3)2 2x2dydx = ∫ 3 0 2x2(\f \f \f \f 9−x2 (x−3)2y) dx which becomes ∫ ∫ R 2x2dxdy = 2 ∫ 3 0 x2((9 − x2) − (x − 3) 2)dx = 2 ∫ 3 0 x2(−2x2 + 6x)dx, and the integral is ∫ 3 0 (−4x4 + 12x3)dx = \f \f \f \f 3 0(−4x5 5 + 3x4) = −4 53 5 + 35. Therefore ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = 3 5/5 = 243/5. Page 8 of 8","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
