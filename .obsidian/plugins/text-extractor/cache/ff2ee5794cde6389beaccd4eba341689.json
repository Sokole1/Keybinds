(6 points) Consider an ‘almost tridiagonal’ n X n matrix A, whose nonzero pattern is like the nonzero pattern of a tridiagonal matrix except a,; # 0. Here is a 6 x 6 example: x x 0 0 0 0 x x x 0 0 0 0 x x x 00 A= . 00 x x x 0 00 0 x x x x 0 0 0 x x (a) If no pivoting is required, what are the nonzero patterns of the factors L and U of the LU decomposition of A? Just write down the nonzero pattern for the 6 x 6 example using x and 0; there is no need to provide a justification. (b) In answering this question, assume that n is large and you may ignore pivoting. State how much additional computational work and how much additional storage are required, if any, for solving the linear system Ax = b, compared to solving a linear system with a tridiagonal matrix. Refer specifically to the following and write your answers on the margins; there is no need to justify your answers. (i) Additional computational work for computing the LU decomposition A = LU, if any (ii) Additional computational work for solving Ly = b, if any (iii) Additional computational work for solving Ux =y, if any (iv) The overall additional storage that is required in the solution process, if any Make sure to refer to the above as a comparison with a standard tridiagonal system and state only the additional computational work and storage.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
