In Section 6.4 we saw the truncated SVD regu- larization method. Another regularization approach, considered here, replaces the normal equations by the modified, better conditioned system (ATA+~D)x, = ATb, where v > 0 is a parameter. (a) Show that k2(A) > ka(AT A+ I). (b) Reformulate the equations for x., as a linear least-squares problem. (c) Show that [|x,||2 < [|x||2- (d) Find a bound for the relative error % in terms of either the largest or the smallest singular value of the matrix A. State a sufficient condition on the value of that would guarantee that the relative error is bounded below a given value ¢. (e) Write a short program to solve the 5 x 4 problem of Example 6.14 regularized as above, using MATLAB’s “backslash”. Try v = 107 for j = 0,3,6 and 12. For each +, calculate the #>-norms of the residual, | Bx, — b||, and the solution, [[%|l. Compare to the results for v = 0 and to those using SVD as reported in Example 6.14. What are your conclusions? (f) For large ill-conditioned least-squares problems, what is a potential advantage of the regularization with -y presented here over minimum norm truncated SVD?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
