The following gambling game is called wheel of fortune or chuck-a-luck. A player chooses a number from 1 to 6 . Three fair dice are rolled, and if the player’s number appears 𝑘 times (for 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) then the player wins $ 𝑘 . If the number does not appear, the player loses $ 1 . Find the player’s expected profit. Answer: We can think of this as a binomial random variable where the player’s number is either rolled, or not. So 𝑝 = 16 , let 𝑋 = # of times the chosen number is rolled. So 𝑋 ∼ Bin ( 3 , 16 ) . 𝑝 ( 𝑋 = 0 ) = ( 30 ) ( 56 ) 3 = 1 2 5 2 1 6 𝑝 ( 𝑋 = 1 ) = ( 31 ) ( 16 ) 1 ( 56 ) 2 = 2 5 7 2 𝑝 ( 𝑋 = 2 ) = ( 32 ) ( 16 ) 2 ( 56 ) 1 = 1 5 2 1 6 𝑝 ( 𝑋 = 3 ) = ( 33 ) ( 16 ) 3 = 1 2 1 6 So expected value is: − 1 ∗ 1 2 5 2 1 6 + 1 ∗ 2 5 7 2 + 2 ∗ 1 5 2 1 6 + 3 ∗ 1 2 1 6 = − 0 . 0 7 8 7 0 3 7 0 3 7 The expected profit is ≈ − $ 0 . 0 7 8 7 Question 22. Smith collects coupons. There are 𝑚 different types of coupons. He receives a new coupon every day, and that coupon is equally likely to be any one of the 𝑚 types. He is interested in how long it would take on average to have a complete set of all 𝑚 coupons. (a) Let 𝑋 be the number of coupons he collects until obtaining a complete set. Explain why 𝑋 can be written as a sum of 𝑚 independent Geometric random variables (say what their parameters are). Answer: Each day he receives a coupon. It is a success if it’s a new coupon, and failure if it’s not a new coupon. Let 𝑚 be the number of different types. So this is a sum of of geometric random variables each corresponding to seeing a new coupon 𝑐 . The probability of a success (seeing a new coupon) is 𝑚 − 𝑐 + 1 𝑚 for 𝑐 = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , 𝑚 where 𝑐 is how many unique coupons he currently has. So how long is: 𝑋 ∼ Geom ( 1 ) + Geom ( 𝑚 − 1 𝑚 ) + Geom ( 𝑚 − 2 𝑚 ) + … + Geom ( 1 𝑚 ) (b) Compute the expected value of 𝑋 . (Use the fact that the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of the expectations.) Answer: The expectation of a geometric series is 1 𝑝 . We can calculate 𝐸 ( 𝑋 ) by summing the expectations of each. So 𝐸 ( 𝑋 ) = 1 + 𝑚 𝑚 − 1 + 𝑚 − 2 𝑚 + … + 𝑚 1 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 3 77253938 Question 33. This problem gives a mathematical explanation of the similarity between the geometric andexponential random variables observed in Assignment 2, Problem 6. Let 𝑌 be a geometric random variable with parameter 𝑝 , so that 𝑌 represents the trial number of the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Suppose the trials occur at times 𝛿 , 2 𝛿 , 3 𝛿 , … , and that 𝛿 and 𝑝 are both very small with 𝛿 𝑝 = 1 𝜆 , with 𝜆 > 0 fixed. At time 𝑡 , about 𝑡 𝛿 trials have taken place. (a) Compute 𝑃 ( 𝑌 > 𝑚 ) , which represents the probability that no success has been observed by time 𝑡 = 𝑚 𝛿 . Answer: 𝑌 ∼ Geom ( 𝑝 ) . 𝑃 ( 𝑌 > 𝑚 ) = 1 − 𝑃 ( 𝑌 ≤ 𝑚 ) = 1 − ( 1 − ( 1 − 𝑝 ) 𝑚 ) = ( 1 − 𝑝 ) 𝑚 (b) Show that the probability that no success has been observed by time 𝑡 converges to 𝑒 − 𝜆 𝑡 , in the limit 𝛿 → 0 and 𝑝 → 0 with 𝛿 𝑝 = 1 𝜆 fixed. Conclude that the time of the first success is approximately an exponential random variable with parameter 𝜆 . Answer: Let 𝐿 be the limit we are trying to find. 𝐿 = lim 𝛿 → 0 lim 𝑝 → 0 ( 1 − 𝑝 ) 𝑚 ln ( 𝐿 ) = lim 𝛿 → 0 lim 𝑝 → 0 𝑚 ln ( 1 − 𝑝 ) By taking the ln of both sides and applying linearity of logarithmsfrom 𝛿 𝑝 = 1 𝜆 we have that 𝑝 = 𝛿 𝜆 , substitute in along with 𝑚 = 𝑡 𝛿 : ln ( 𝐿 ) = lim 𝛿 → 0 𝑡 ln ( 1 − 𝛿 𝜆 ) 𝛿 . This is 00 indeterminate form since ln ( 1 ) = 0 . Apply L’Hopitals rule by taking derivative of numerator and denominator separately with respect to 𝛿 ln ( 𝐿 ) = lim 𝛿 → 0 ( − 𝜆 𝑡 1 − 𝛿 𝜆 ) ln ( 𝐿 ) = ( − 𝜆 𝑡 1 ) = − 𝜆 𝑡 . Take the exponential of both sides: 𝐿 = 𝑒 − 𝜆 𝑡 qed. 2 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 3 77253938 Question 44. A binary message - either 0 or 1 -must be transmitted by wire from location A to location B. However, data sent over the wire are subject to channel noise disturbance, so to reduce the possibility of error, the value 2 is sent if the message is 1 and the value −1 is sent if the message is 0 . If 𝑥 is the value sent at 𝐴 ( 𝑥 = − 1 or 𝑥 = 2 ) , then the value received at B is 𝑅 = 𝑥 + 𝑁 , where 𝑁 represents the noise. Assume that 𝑁 is a normal random variable with mean 𝜇 = 0 and variance 𝜎 2 = 0 . 2 5 . Assume that a message sent is equally likely to be 0 or 1 . When the message is received at B the receiver decodes it according to the following rule: If 𝑅 ≥ 0 . 5 , then 1 is concluded. If 𝑅 < 0 . 5 , then 0 is concluded. The message concluded at 𝐵 is 1 . What is the probability that the message was incorrectly transmitted?(Recall that if 𝑋 ∼ 𝑁 ( 𝜇 , 𝜎 2 ) then the random variable 𝑍 = 𝑋 − 𝜇 𝜎 is standard normal, 𝑍 ∼ 𝑁 ( 0 , 1 ) , and use symmetry and the Table in Ross.) Answer: For it to be incorrect, that means the actual message was 0 which corresponds to 𝑥 = − 1 . Therefore we had that 𝑥 + 𝑁 ≥ 0 . 5 ⇒ = 1 + 𝑁 ≥ 0 . 5 ⇒ 𝑁 ≥ 1 . 5 which corresponds to computing 1 − 𝑁 ≤ 1 . 5 . 𝑍 = 𝑋 − 𝜇 𝜎 = 1 . 5 − 0√ 0 . 2 5 = 3 . Using the table from Ross the probability to the left of 𝑍 = 3 = 0 . 9 9 8 7 so the probability of being greater is 1 − 0 . 9 9 8 7 = 0.0013 Question 55. An airline books passengers for a flight on an airplane with 500 seats. From experience, theairline knows that each passenger has probability 𝑝 = 0 . 0 7 of missing the flight. As such, the airline takes a risk and books 525 passengers for the flight. (a) Compute the true probability that the flight in question is overbooked. One helpfulcommand here is binom. cdf from the scipy package: calling binom.cdf(x, N, p) returns the CDFof a binomial random variable with parameters 𝑁 and 𝑝 evaluated at 𝑥 . That is, if 𝐵 is Bin(N, p), binom.cdf(x,N,p) returns 𝑃 ( 𝐵 ≤ 𝑥 ) . from scipy . stats import binom # 1 - 0.07 = 0.93 chances of passenger being on the flight # Odds of being overbooked are 1 - P(B <= x) x = 500 n = 525 p = 0 . 93 ans_a = 1 - binom . cdf ( x , n , p ) # ans_a = 0.01406710273230094 3 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 3 77253938 (b) Use the Poisson approximation to compute an approximation to this true probability. Here, you may find the poisson.cdf command helpful from the scipy package: poisson.cdf(x,lambda)returns the CDF of a Poisson random variable with parameter 𝜆 evaluated at 𝑥 . `from scipy . stats import poisson # Now approximate P(B <= x) with poisson. Works for large n and small p # lambda = np x = 500 n = 525 p = 0 . 93 lamb = n * p ans_b = 1 - poisson . cdf ( x , lamb ) # ans_b = 0.28787328188070627 (c) Simulate the number of no-shows for a booked flight 40000 times. Compute the proportionof times which the airline overbooks the flight. import numpy as np n = 525 p = 0 . 93 trials = 40000 # Sample 40000 times passenger_count = np . random . binomial ( n , p , trials ) num_overbooked = 0 for count in passenger_count : if count > 500 : num_overbooked += 1 proportion = num_overbooked / trials # proportion = 0.01465 4 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 3 77253938 (d) After you have simulated the no-shows 40000 times, define 𝑂 𝑛 = number of overbookings in the first 𝑛 simulated bookings; then 𝑂 𝑛 𝑛 is the running proportion of overbookings in the first 𝑛 simulated bookings. Plot this running proportion against 𝑛 . What happens to it as 𝑛 gets large? Note: When calculating 𝑂 𝑛 , do not simulate 𝑛 new bookings for every 𝑛 . Simulate 40000 bookings first, and then for every 𝑛 , calculate 𝑂 𝑛 based on the first 𝑛 of these bookings. Print out and submit: your code; the answers to parts (a), (b), and (c); and your plot for part(d). import matplotlib . pyplot as plt def proportion_overbooked ( num_passengers ) : total = 0 for count in num_passengers : if count > 500 : total += 1 return total / len ( num_passengers ) proportions = [ ] n = [ x for x in range ( 1 , trials + 1 ) ] for i in range ( 1 , trials + 1 ) : proportions . append ( proportion_overbooked ( passenger_count [ : i ] ) ) plt . plot ( n , proportions ) plt . xlabel ( \" n \" ) plt . ylabel ( \" proportion \" ) plt . title ( \" Proportion of overbookings versus n trials \" ) plt . legend ( ) plt . show ( ) 5 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 3 77253938 As 𝑛 gets very large, it approaches the value we computed in part (a). In the beginning the proportion highly fluctuates then stables out. 6","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
