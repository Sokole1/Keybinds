There is a corresponding linear least-squares problem here, which you are not required to find. Denote C=ATA+al Show that the matrix C' is symmetric positive definite (and therefore Cholesky can be used). Do this in two steps, as follows. (There is no need to discuss the solution method, just show what you are being asked to show below.)
