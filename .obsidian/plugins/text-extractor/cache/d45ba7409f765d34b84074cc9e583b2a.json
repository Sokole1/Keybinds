Find the greatest common divisors of the following pairs of integers (i) (-12, 18), (ii) (1001, 289), (iii) (-27,-45), and express the gcd as a linear combination of the corresponding pairs. (4x3=12 pts) 2. Show that the greatest common divisor of two even numbers is even while the greatest common divisor of an odd number and an even number is odd. (4 pts) 3. What is (a2 + b2, a + b) if a and b are relatively prime integers that are not both zero? Justify your answer. (3pts) 4. If p, l, q are three prime numbers, show that in the set (pl, lq, pq) any two integers are not relatively prime but the set of the three integers are mutually relatively prime, in the sense that their greatest common divisor is 1.
