There is no need to justify your answer; just write T/F at a visible place. (a) Even if a matrix A is perfectly conditioned, i.e., k(A) = 1, Gaussian Elimination without pivoting for solving a linear system Ax = b may still break down due to division by zero. (b) Ignoring roundoff errors, if during the kth step of Gaussian elimination with partial piv- oting for solving a linear system Ax = b, i.e., during the step of zeroing the entries below the kth diagonal, a row of zeros is generated in the interim matrix AK) (in the notation used in the lectures/textbook/slides), then the original matrix A is necessarily singular and the linear system does not have a unique solution. (c) When numerically solving a sparse linear system Ax = b using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, the required computational work and storage are always equivalent in big O terms to the computational work and storage required for solving the linear system by computing A~ explicitly first, and then computing x = A~'b. (d) For a dense symmetric positive definite matrix A, thanks to symmetry and because no pivoting is required, computing the Cholesky decomposition and using it to solve the linear system Ax = b is computationally cheaper by an order of magnitude than standard Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting — it takes only O(nz) floating point operations. (e) Suppose we numerically solve a linear system Ax = b and the computed solution is X. Even if the norm of the relative residual, j—'f”b‘_b/“i“ is small, the norm of the relative error H—’[‘ﬁi” may be large. (f) In the solution of the linear least-squares problem min, ||b— Ax||s, the residual r = b— Ax is orthogonal to Ax. (g) The matrix H = I — 2uu’, with ||uflz = 1, is not always invertible, i.e., one can find a vector u with with |lu||; = 1 such that H is singular. (h) The matrix G' = I — uu’, where where ||ul|; = 1, is symmetric and it satisfies G* = G. You may use the space below to write your own notes, but only your T/F answers will be marked.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
