A person’s eye colour is determined by a pair of genes, one of which is inherited independently from each parent. Each gene can be blue-eye or brown-eye. A gene inherited from a parent is equally likely to be either of that parent’s two genes. The brown-eye gene is dominant in the sense that if at least one gene is the brown-eye gene then eye colour will be brown, whereas if both genes are blue-eye genes then eye colour will be blue. Smith and both his parents have brown eyes, whereas Smith’s sister has blue eyes. a) What is the probability that Smith possesses the blue-eye gene? b) Smith’s wife has blue eyes. What is the probability that their first child will have blue eyes? c¢) If their first child has brown eyes, what is the probability that their second child will also have brown eyes?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
