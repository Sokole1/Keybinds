The term fill-in (or fill) refers to entries of the matrix that are orig- inally zero but turn into nonzero entries during the elimination process. Significant fill-in may dramatically increase the computational work and storage. Let us give a motivating example. Example 5.1. Consider an n x n matrix A whose elements satisfy x ifi=jori=lorj=1 a;; = . . 0 otherwise Here x corresponds to a nonzero entry. An illustration of A for a5 x 5 case is given below.?Â® Consider X X X X X x x 0 0 0 A= x 0 x 0 O . x 0 0 x 0 x 0 0 0 x Notice that A is structurally symmetric, which means that a;; # 0 implies that a;; # 0. Let us not concern ourselves for the moment with the numerical values in A; as such, we will not assume that A is necessarily (numerically) symmetric. Obviously, such considerations are important in general. Suppose that B is obtained by swapping the first and last equations in the linear system, as well as the first and last unknowns. This corresponds to swapping the first and last rows and the first and last columns in A. In the right-hand side vector we swap the first and last elements. The result is a matrix B whose elements are given by X ifi=jori=norj=n bij = . . 0 otherwise An illustration of the sparsity pattern of B for the 5 x 5 case is given by x 0 0 0 x 0 x 0 0 x B=| 0 0 x 0 x |[. 0 0 0 x x X X X X X","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
