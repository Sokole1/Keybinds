(1.1.2) Solve dy dx = x2 + x for y(1) = 3. Answer. Rewrite the DE as dy = (x2 + x)dx. Integrating, y = 1 3 x3 + 1 2 x2 + c. Using y(1) = 3, we get 3 = 1 3 + 1 2 + c, thus c = 13 6 , and hence y = 1 3 x3 + 1 2 x2 + 13 6 . 2. (1.1.7) Solve dy dx = 1 y + 1 for y(0) = 0. Answer. Rewrite the DE as (y + 1)dy = dx. Integrating, 1 2 y2 + y = x + c. Using y(0) = 0, we get 0 + 0 = 0 + c, thus c = 0, and 1 2 y2 + y = x. Completing square, (y + 1)2 = 2x + 1. Thus y + 1 = ± √2x + 1. Since (x, y) is near (0, 0), we take positive sign, and y = −1 + √ 2x + 1. Remark. The maximal interval of existence is − 1 2 < x < ∞. 1 3. (1.2.6) Match equations y′ = 1 − x, y′ = x − 2y, y′ = x(1 − y) to slope ﬁelds. Justify.1.2. SLOPE FIELDS 21 If A = 0, then y = 0 is a solution. For example, when A = 1 the solution “blows up” at x = 1. Hence, the solution does not exist for all x even if the equation is nice everywhere. The equation y 0 = y 2 certainly looks nice. For most of this course we will be interested in equations where existence and uniqueness holds, and in fact holds “globally” unlike for the equation y 0 = y 2. 1.2.3 Exercises Exercise 1.2.1: Sketch slope ﬁeld for y 0 = ex\u0000y. How do the solutions behave as x grows? Can you guess a particular solution by looking at the slope ﬁeld? Exercise 1.2.2: Sketch slope ﬁeld for y0 = x2. Exercise 1.2.3: Sketch slope ﬁeld for y 0 = y 2. Exercise 1.2.4: Is it possible to solve the equation y 0 = xy cos x for y(0) = 1? Justify. Exercise 1.2.5: Is it possible to solve the equation y 0 = y p|x| for y(0) = 0? Is the solution unique? Justify. Exercise 1.2.6: Match equations y0 = 1 \u0000 x, y 0 = x \u0000 2y, y0 = x(1 \u0000 y) to slope ﬁelds. Justify. a) b) c) Exercise 1.2.7 (challenging): Take y 0 = f (x, y), y(0) = 0, where f (x, y) > 1 for all x and y. If the solution exists for all x, can you say what happens to y(x) as x goes to positive inﬁnity? Explain. Exercise 1.2.8 (challenging): Take (y \u0000 x)y 0 = 0, y(0) = 0. a) Find two distinct solutions. b) Explain why this does not violate Picard’s theorem. Exercise 1.2.101: Sketch the slope ﬁeld of y 0 = y 3. Can you visually ﬁnd the solution that satisﬁes y(0) = 0? Exercise 1.2.102: Is it possible to solve y 0 = xy for y(0) = 0? Is the solution unique? Exercise 1.2.103: Is it possible to solve y 0 = x x2\u00001 for y(1) = 0? Exercise 1.2.104: Match equations y0 = sin x, y 0 = cos y, y0 = y cos(x) to slope ﬁelds. Justify. a) b) c) Answer. (b) is for y′ = 1 − x, since the slope ﬁeld is independent of y. (c) is for y′ = x − 2y, since the slopes are the same on every level set x − 2y = c. (a) is for y′ = x(1 − y) since it is the remaining case, and the picture is symmetric with respect to the center (0, 1). 4. (§1.2) Solve the problem y′ + y3 = 0, y(0) = y0, and determine how the interval in which the solution exists depends on the initial value y0. Answer. If y0 = 0, the solution y(t) = 0 exists for all t. If y0 ̸= 0, the equation is separable, with dy/y3 = −dt. Integrating both sides and invoking the initial condition, − 1 2 y−2 = −t − 1 2 y−2 0 and thus y−2 = 2t + y−2 0 . If y0 > 0, then y(t) > 0 for all t in the domain. So y(t) = 1 √ 2t + y−2 0 for t > − 1 2 y−2 0 . If y0 < 0, then y(t) < 0 for all t in the domain. So y(t) = − 1 √ 2t + y−2 0 for t > − 1 2 y−2 0 . 5. (§1.2) (a) Verify that both y1(t) = 1 − t and y2(t) = −t2/4 are solutions of the initial value problem y′ = −t + (t2 + 4y)1/2 2 , y(2) = −1. Where are these solutions valid? (b) Explain why the existence of two solutions of the given problem does not contradict the uniqueness part of Theorem 1.2.1. Answer. (a) For y = y1(t) = 1 − t, y(2) = −1, y′ = −1 while (RHS = right hand side) RHS(DE) = 1 2 (−t + (t2 + 4 − 4t) 1/2) = 1 2 (−t + |t − 2|) which is −1 if t ≥ 2 and 1 − t if t < 2. Thus y1 satisﬁes the DE for t ≥ 2. For y = y2(t) = −t2/4, y(2) = −1, y′ = −t/2 while RHS(DE) = 1 2 (−t + (t2 − t2)1/2) = −t/2 which is y′. Thus y2 satisﬁes the DE for all t ∈ R. (b) By Theorem 2.4.2 we are guaranteed a unique solution only where f (t, y) = 1 2 (−t + (t2 + 4y)1/2) and fy(t, y) = (t2 + 4y)−1/2 are continuous. In this case the initial point (2, −1) lies in 2 the region t2 + 4y ≤ 0 so fy is not continuous and hence the theorem is not applicable and there is no contradiction. 6. (§1.3) Solve y′ + y2 sin x = 0. Answer. If y(x0) = 0 for some x0, then y(x) = 0 for all x. If y ̸= 0, the DE may be written as y−2dy = − sin x dx. Integrating both sides, we get −y−1 = cos x + c, or y = −1/(cos x + c). Note: For any given initial data y(x0) = y0 ̸= 0, we have cos x + c ̸= 0 for x near x0. The interval of existence is ﬁnite if |c| ≤ 1. 7. (§1.3) Consider y′ = (1 − 2x)/y, y(1) = −2. (a) Find the solution in explicit form. (b) Plot the graph of the solution. (c) Determine the interval in which the solution is deﬁned. Answer. (a) Rewrite as ydy = (1 − 2x)dx. Integrating we get y2/2 = x − x2 + c. Using y(1) = −2 we get c = 2. Thus y(x) = − √4 + 2x − 2x2, where the negative sign is due to y(1) < 0. (b) Answer. (c) The solution is deﬁned if 4 + 2x − 2x2 > 0. Thus the interval of existence is (−1, 2). 8. (§1.3) Solve (an implicit solution of) y′ = (1 + 3x2)/(3y2 − 6y), y(0) = 1. Answer. We have (3y2 − 6y)dy = (1 + 3x2)dx so that y3 − 3y2 = x + x3 + c. Using y(0) = 1 we get c = −2, and y3 − 3y2 = x + x3 − 2, which deﬁnes y as an implicit function of x near (x, y) = (0, 1). 9. (§1.4) Solve y′ − y = 2te2t, y(0) = 1. Answer. µ(t) = e−t so that (e−ty)′ = 2tet and thus e −ty(t) = ∫ 2tetdt = 2tet − 2 ∫ etdt = 2(t − 1)et + c. Setting t = 0 and y = 1 we get 1 = −2 + c, or c = 3. Hence y(t) = 2(t − 1)e2t + 3et. 3 10. (§1.4) Solve ty′ + 2y = t2 − t + 1, y(1) = 1 2 , t > 0. Answer. Rewrite as y′ + p(t)y = g(t) with p(t) = 2/t and g(t) = t − 1 + 1/t. Take µ(t) = exp( ∫ 2dt t ) = t2 so that (t2y)′ = t3 − t2 + t. Integrating and dividing by t2 gives y = t2/4 − t/3 + 1/2 + c/t2. Setting t = 1 and y = 1/2 we have c = 1/12. Thus y = t2/4 − t/3 + 1/2 + 1 12t2 .
