Question 6.6. is hard and you should not worry about it. Questions 6.17 through 6.19 are not covered in this course (advanced material). Question 6.7 (a) Even if we ignore the technical question of how to compute the LU decomposition of a rectan- gular matrix we observe that multiplying by the L (or U ) factors or related quantities will not preserve the ℓ2-norm, whereas multiplying by the orthogonal factor Q of the QR decomposition does. (b) We have x = R−1(RT )−1RT Q T b = R−1Q T b. It is the replacement of (RT ) −1RT by the identity which accounts for the conditioning improvement despite the sequence of equalities. Question 6.8 (a) A has full column rank if and only if the symmetric matrix B = AT A is positive deﬁnite. But B = RT R, so in fact R is a Cholesky factor of B. As such, the upper triangular matrix R must be nonsingular, which implies that its diagonal elements are all nonzero. (b) This part can be proved in the same fashion as in (a), noting that although Q is not square we have Q T Q = I. Question 6.12 (ﬁrst part) (a) If the matrix is rank deﬁcient, at some point we will not be able to generate a new direction qj that is orthogonal to the previous ones. We will then get a zero vector and hence a zero rjj. Question 6.15 (a) If A = U ΣV T then AT A = V ΣT ΣV T and the eigenvalues of A are given by σ2 i . Since the rank of A is n, it means all singular values are nonzero. Therefore all eigenvalues of AT A are positive and it is nonsingular (and in fact symmetric positive deﬁnite). (b) We have x = (AT A) −1AT b and therefore r = b − Ax = (I − A(AT A)−1AT ) b. We thus have P = (I − A(AT A) −1AT ). P is shown to be an orthogonal projector in the post-lecture slides. (c) The ﬁgure provides the necessary interpretation. 1 (d) Let us use here the economy size QR, namely A = ̂QR where ̂Q is m-by-n with orthonormal columns and R is n-by-n. Then we have AT A = RT ̂Q T ̂QR = RT R and hence (AT A) −1 = R−1R−T . It follows that P = I − A(AT A)−1AT = I − ̂Q RR−1 | {z } I R−T RT | {z } I ̂Q T = I − ̂Q ̂Q T . So, the projector in fact does not depend on R. Remark: It is important to note that while ˆQ T ˆQ = I (of size n × n), we have ˆQ ˆQ T ̸= I (this matrix is of size m × m). This is mentioned in the slide that describes the economy-size QR decomposition. (e) Suppose x solves the original least-squares problem with b, and y solves the modiﬁed least- squares problem with c. We will show that y = x. Indeed, x = (AT A)−1AT b and y = (AT A)−1AT c, and therefore y − x = (AT A) −1AT (c − b) = (AT A) −1AT (αr) = α(AT A) −1 (AT r) | {z } ⃗0 , since AT r = AT (b − Ax) = ⃗0 by the fundamental orthogonality property of the least-squares problem (which leads to the normal equations). Therefore x = y, as required. Question 6.16 Mostly given in Assignment 4, and no need to worry about truncated SVD in part (f). 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
