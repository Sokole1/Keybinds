What are the requirements for e? b) Suppose Bob chose e = 2141. What are the requirements for d? c) Which of the six items among n, p, q, e, ϕ(n), d (notation as in class) will comprise Bob’s Public key? d) Which of the six items will comprise Bob’s private key? e) Alice wants to send Bob a secret message. She downloads his public key. The message is P = 1234. What should she compute in order to encrypt this message for him? (Your answer should be a formula, with numbers but not variables.) (5pts) 2. What is the plaintext message that corresponds to the ciphertext 1213 0902 0539 1208 1234 1103 1374 that is produced using modular exponentiation with modulus p = 2591 and encryption key e = 13? Mention clearly what information is required to decode. That information is 797 and 0314 1314 1917 0400 0319 0708 1823. You are expected to know what 797 is and what the blocks of four digits are corresponding to the ciphertext. Write the decryption formula clearly. (3pts) 3. What is the plain text message that corresponds to the ciphertext 01 09 00 12 12 09 24 10 that is produced using modular exponentiation with modulus p = 29 and encryption key e = 5? You are given that d = 17. Write down the encyrption and decryption formulae. The decrypted number blocks are 01 04 00 12 12 04 20 15. How do you interpret these numbers in terms of the cipher text? (5pts) 1 4. Show that the encryption and decryption procedures are identical when encryption is done using modular exponentiation with modulus p = 31 and encryption key e = 11. (3pts) 5. Find the primes p and q if n = pq = 14, 647 and ϕ(n) = 14, 400. (4pts) 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
