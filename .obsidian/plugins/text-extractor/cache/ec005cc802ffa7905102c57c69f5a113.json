Your algorithm receives as input: e A bunch of uncategorized photos. o A similarity measure for each pair of photos, where a 0 similarity indicates two photos are nothing like each other; a 1 indicates two photos are exactly the same. All other similarities are in between. e The number of categories to group them into. Your algorithm should create a categorization: the requested number of categories, where a category is a non-empty set of photos. Every photo belongs to some category, and no photo belongs to more than one category. So, a categorization is a partition. We’d like similar photos to be in the same category. Step 1: Build intuition through examples. 1. Write down small and trivial instances of the problem. What data structure is useful to represent a problem instance? Write down also potential solutions for your instances. Are some solutions better than others? How so?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
