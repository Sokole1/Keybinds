Problem 1: Consider the IVP (initial value problem): (x \u0000 1)y′′ \u0000 (x \u0000 3)y′ \u0000 y = 0 ; y(0) = 3 ; y′(0) = 3 : Determine a power series solution centred about x0 = 0. Rewrite your answer in terms of elementary functions. Problem 2: By using a power series representation centred about x0 = 0 determine the general solution of (x2 + 1)y′′ + 7 2xy′ + y = 0 : Problem 3: Substitute the power series ∑∞ n=0 anxn into y′′ + x2y′ + y = 0 ; and determine a recursion relation describing the an's. Compute a2, a3, a4 and a5 in terms of a0 and a1. Problem 4: Find all singular points of the following ODEs and determine whether each one is regular or irregular. a) x2y′′ + 3y′ + 2xy = 0 b) (x2 \u0000 1) 2y′′ + (x + 1)y′ + (x + 2)y = 0 c) sin2(x)y′′ + sin( x 2 )y′ + 2y = 0 d) x2 sinh(x)y′′ + x3y′ + cosh(x)y = 0 Problem 5: Determine a lower bound for the radius of convergence of series solutions for the given ODE about the corresponding point x0. (You should not try to compute the series solution itself.) a) (x2 \u0000 3)y′′ + y′ + tan(x)y = 0; x0 = 0 b) (4x2 + 9)y′′ + x3y′ + y = 0: x0 = 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
