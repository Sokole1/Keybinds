Write down the number or numbers z; (if there are any) for which overflow will occur. [1 mark] ii. Write down the number(s) z; (if there are any) for which no overflow will occur but a cancellation error will occur which causes the resulting computation to be zero. [1 mark] iii. Rewrite the formula for f(z) in a way that makes it more suit- able for numerical computations and avoids some situations of overflow and cancellation errors.
