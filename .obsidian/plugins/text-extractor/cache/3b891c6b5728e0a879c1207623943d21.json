This trick works when there is a steady state and only when the source term and boundary conditions do not depend on time. For instance, Uy = tUyy +sinz cannot be solved using this method. Assuming u; = 0 is not enough since we also need to take t — oo and we cannot find a u = 4(z) that solves tUuy, +sinz =0 ‘We can, however, guess a particular solution of the equation or more generally solve the full problem using the eigenfunction method.

Try for a steady solution: uZ (z) = 0, us(z) = az + b, u, = a but then we cannot match both BC unless A = B = a. This means that if we are pumping and removing heat from the rod at different rates then the temperature does not reach a steady state. Since the boundary conditions are given on the spatial derivative, we first look for a func- tion ¢(z,t) that satisfies both the PDE and the nonhomogeneous Neumann conditions. 107 —— We assume a solution of the form é(z,t) = az? + bx + c + dt, where a, b, ¢, d are constants (possibly depending on the data).
