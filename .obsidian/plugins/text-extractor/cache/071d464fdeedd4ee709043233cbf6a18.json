A set which is a subset of the real numbers is well-ordered if the set has a least element. State which of the following sets are well-ordered, with full details justifying your answer. (8pts; 2x4) (a) The set of even positive integers. (b) The set of positive rational numbers of the form a/2 wherea is a positive integer. (c) The set of non-negative real rational numbers. (d) The set of all positive integers of the form a − bk. 2. The greatest integer of a real number x denoted by [x] is the largest integer less than or equal to x, so x satisﬁes [x] ≤ x < [x] + 1. The greatest integer of x is also called the integral part of x. The fractional part of a real number x denoted {x} is the diﬀerence between x and the largest integer less than or equal to x, i.e. {x} = x − [x]. Write down the values of [−1/4], {8/5}, {7}, [22/7], {−22/7}, [5/4], [−11/4], {−1/3}. 4pts 3. Use mathematical induction to prove that n∑ k=1 1 k2 = 1 12 + 1 22 + · · · + 1 n2 ≤ 2 − 1 n whenever n is a positive integer. 4pts 4. What function f (n) is deﬁned recursively by f (1) = 2 and f (n + 1) = wf (n) for n ≥ 1? Prove your answer using mathematical induction. (2+3=5 pts) 5. (i) Hexadecimal notation represents numbers to the base 16. There are 16 digits, 0, 1, · · · 15, and the letters A, B, C, D, E, F. Convert (9A0B)16 to binary (base 2) notation. 6. (ii) Show that n! is O(nn). (2+2=4 pts) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
