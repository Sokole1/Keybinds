We say that a vector field F is conservative on a domain D if it is defined on D and there is a scalar function ¢ defined on D such that F = V¢ on D. In the lecture, we have seen that the vector field - -y x Fz,y) = (-2 > @) = G ) is not conservative on the domain R2\\ {(0,0)}. In this exercise, we will show that F is conservative on a smaller domain. (a) Find the domain D of the function ¢(z,y) = arctan(y/z). (b) Show that F is conservative on D (Hint: Compute Vi(z,y)). (c) Is D open? Is D connected? Give reasons for your answer.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
