Consider the following autonomous 2D system of DE’s: x′ = x(4 − αx − 2y), y′ = 2y(−3 + x), where α > 0. (3 pt) a) For what values of α there is a critical point in the interior of the ﬁrst quadrant (where x, y > 0)? Suppose that α = 1 in the following questions. (2 pt) b) Find and sketch the nullclines of this system in positive (x, y). The x-nullcline is where x′ = 0. The y-nullcline is where y′ = 0. 2 (2 pt) c) Determine the critical points. (7 pt) d) For each critical point ﬁnd the corresponding linear system. Classify each criti- cal point as to type, and determine whether it is asymptotically stable, stable, or unstable. 3 (2 pt) e) Sketch trajectories in the neighborhood of the critical point which is in the interior of the ﬁrst quadrant (where x, y > 0). 4 (6 pt) 2. a) Match the following DE with the direction ﬁeld.

Do not ﬁnd the transient part. 11 (2 pt) c) Let A(c) denote the maximum amplitude of the steady state solutions of the systems x′′ + cx′ + 9x = cos(ωt), x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 2. among all possible ω > 0. What happens to A(c) as c → 0+? Explain why. Hint.
