Choose which statements (if any) must be true of f and g, when the input is a connected graph with n vertices and m edges. 1. f (n, m) = nm + n log n, and g(n, m) = n2. f (n, m) = O(g(n, m)) g(n, m) = O(f (n, m)) 2. f (n, m) = n4, and g(n, m) = m2 f (n, m) = O(g(n, m)) g(n, m) = O(f (n, m)) 3. f (n, m) = 1.3m, and g(n, m) = 2n f (n, m) = O(g(n, m)) g(n, m) = O(f (n, m)) 2 Graphs True or False Let G be a connected, undirected graph whose edges have nonnegative weights. Let P be a shortest path from a source node s to a target node t of G. 1. Suppose that we increase all the edge weights by 1. Must P still be a shortest path from s to t? Yes No 2. Suppose that we multiply all the edge weights by 10. Must P still be a shortest path from s to t? Yes No 3. Suppose that all edges of G happen to have exactly the same weight. Will breadth ﬁrst search (ignoring weights) starting from node s ﬁnd the shortest path to t? Yes No 3 Vulnerable Nodes In a connected network with n ≥ 3 nodes (processors), messages are sent along bi-directional links (undirected edges) between pairs of nodes. However, if a node v fails, then no messages can be sent along links incident on v. If failure of v could cause two other nodes of the network to become disconnected, we call v a vulnerability. Indicate whether the following statements are true or false. 1. Suppose that for some node i, the breadth ﬁrst search tree rooted at i has just one internal node at some level > 0. Then the network must contain a vulnerability. True False 2. Suppose that the diameter of the network (as deﬁned in the worksheet on graphs) is greater than n/2. Then the network must contain a vulnerability. True False If the diameter is greater than n/2, then the length (number of edges) of the shortest path between some pair of nodes, say a and b, is greater than n/2. Accordingly, the depth (number of levels) of the bfs tree rooted at a (or b) is greater than n/2 + 1. From this it follows that some level > 0 of the tree has just one internal node, and by part 1 the network must contain a vulnerability. 3. Suppose that the radius of the network is greater than n/4. Then the network must contain a vulnerability. True False A graph containing four nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, with edges (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1) has radius 2 (we deﬁne the radius as mini∈V maxj∈V d(i, j). But this graph does not contain a vulnerability.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
