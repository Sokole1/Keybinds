A 2 liter tank of water contains 3 grams of salt at time t = 0 (in minutes). Brine with concen- tration 3t grams of salt per liter at time t is added at a rate of one liter per minute. The tank is mixed well and is drained at 1 liter per minute. At what positive time is there a minimum amount of salt and what is that amount? Solution: We let y be the grams of salt in the tank. Then y(0) = 3 and dy dt = 3t − y 2 . An integrating factor is r = e t 2 . A particular solution is given by yp = e− t 2 ∫ 3te t 2 dt = e− t 2 ((2)3te t 2 − 2 ∫ 3e t 2 dt ) = 6t − 12. Solving for the initial condition we have y = 6t − 12 + 15e− t 2 . To ﬁnd the minimum, we diﬀerentiate and set this equal to zero to get 0 = 6 − 15 2 e − t 2 so e −t/2 = 12 15 . −t/2 = ln(12/15) so t = 2ln(15/12) ≈ 0.4463. The amount of salt is y(2ln(15/12)) = 12ln(15/12) ≈ 2.678. 2. Consider the equation y′ = sin(y). (a) Find all critical points. (b) Classify their stability. (c) What range of inital conditions results in solutions with limt→∞ y(t) = 0. What about limt→∞ y(t) = π 2 and limt→∞ y(t) = π? Solution: (a) Critical points are at integer multiples of π. (b) The even multiples of π are unstable and the odd multiples are asymptotically stable. (c) Only the initial condition y(0) = 0 results in limt→∞ y(t) = 0. There is no initial condition that results in limt→∞ y(t) = π 2 , and initial values y0 ∈ (0, 2π) result in limt→∞ y(t) = π. 3. For a ball of mass m > 0 with velocity v in the direction of the earth, the velocity obeys the diﬀerential equation ˙v = g − κ m v2 where g > 0 is the gravitational constant and κ > 0 is a constant of air resistence. 1 (a) Classify all critical points. (b) Explain the long term behavior for every initial condition. When is this model for air resistence physically realistic? Solution: (a) The critical points are at v∗ = ± √ mg κ . The positive critical point is stable and the negative critical point is unstable. (b) If y0 > − √ mg κ then the velocity of the ball will eventually approach the positive critical point. If y0 = − √ mg κ the solution will stay constant, and if y0 < − √ mg κ the solution diverges to −∞. The model is only realistic for v ≥ 0, otherwise the air resistence is accelerating the ball! 4. Solve the diﬀerential equation 4x3 + 6x2y2 + 4x 3y dy dx = 0 with y(1) = 1. On what interval does the solution exist? Solution: We ﬁnd that the equation is exact with F (x, y) = 2x3y2 + x4 = C. Pluging in the initial condition, F (1, 1) = 3. Solving for y, we have y = √ 3 − x4 2x3 . . This solution exists for 0 < x < 3 1 4 . 5. Find two distinct solutions to the diﬀerential equation 3x2y + (4y3 + x3) dy dx = 0 with y(0) = 0. Solution: We ﬁnd the equation is exact with F (x, y) = y4 + x3y = C, and since F (0, 0) = 0 we have y4 + x3y = 0. There is a solution with y = 0 and a second solution with y3 + x3 = 0, so y = −x. 6. Solve y2ex + 2y dy dx = 0, y(0) = 1. Solution: We calculate ∂M ∂y − ∂N ∂x = 2ye x so the equation is not exact. However, dividing by N we have ∂M ∂y − ∂N ∂x N = e x. 2 and so there is an integrating factor as a function of x. This integrating factor is u = e ex. After multiplying by u, the equation becomes eexy2e x + 2ye ex dy dx which is exact with F (x, y) = eexy2 = C. Plugging in the initial condition, we have C = e and y = √ e eex = e 1 2 (1−ex). This could also been done as a seperable equation. 7. (1.7.5) Approximate the value of e by looking at the initial value problem y′ = y with y(0) = 1 and approximating y(1) using Eulers method with a step size of 0.2. Solution: y(0.2) ≈ y(0) + 0.2y(0) = 1.2 y(0.4) ≈ 1.2y(0.2) = 1.44 y(0.6) ≈ 1.2y(0.4) = 1.728 y(0.8) ≈ 1.2y(0.6) = 2.0736 y(1) ≈ 1.2y(0.8) ≈ 2.4883. The actual value of e is close to 2.71828. 3 MATH 215/255 Homework 2M Submit online via Canvas by 6pm, Wednesday, September 25, 2019 M1. Consider the initial value problem y′ = ty − y, y(0) = 0.5 A. Use MATLAB to implement Euler’s method with each step size h = 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and plot the results in a single ﬁgure. Solve the ODE and plot the exact solution in the same ﬁgure. Include a title and a legend. Save the ﬁgure as M1.fig. You may use the function euler provided in the ﬁle euler.m. Solution: The solution to the ODE is given by y = 0.5et2/2−t. In the ﬁgure we see that the error is essentially decreasing by half when we halve the step size. M2. Consider the ﬁrst order autonomous diﬀerential equation y′ = −2 + 5y2 − y5 (a) Use the MATLAB function plot to plot the right-side of the equation f (y) = −2 + 5y2 − y5 on the interval −2 ≤ y ≤ 2 (with y on horizontal axis). Save the ﬁgure as autonomous.fig. (b) Finding exact values of roots of a degree 5 polynomial is impossible in general, but we can always use MATLAB to approximate. Use the MATLAB function fzero to ﬁnd all the critical points of the equation. Save the critical points (in increasing order) in a vector called critical. For example, if you ﬁnd critical points y1 = 2, y2 = 1, y3 = −2, y4 = 0 and y5 = −0.5 then 4 >> critical = [-2,-0.5,0,1,2]; The MATLAB function fzero takes a function handle f and initial guess x0 and returns a solution (if possible) of f (x) = 0. For example: >> f = @(x) x^2 - 1; >> root = fzero(f,0.8); >> root root = 1 Use the plot in part (a) to get an idea of how many critical points there are and their locations. (c) Let y(t) be the unique solution satisfying y(0) = 0. Determine the limit lim t→∞ y(t) and save the value as a variable L. Submit the ﬁles autonomous.fig and assignment.mat with variables critical and L. Solution (a) Figure autonomous.fig (b) There are 3 critical points critical = -0.6180 0.6506 1.6180 (c) Since f (0) < 0 and −0.6180 < 0 < 0.6506, we have 5 L = -0.6180 6","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
