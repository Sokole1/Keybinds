Chapter 1 Review of techniques to solve Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations The aim of this ﬁrst lecture is to provide you with a warm-up on some techniques for solving Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations (ODEs). You are likely already familiar with these techniques, as they were introduced in Math 215, 255, and 256. We will brieﬂy review some of them. 1.1 Separable equations Deﬁnition 1.1.1 We say that a ﬁrst-order ODE is separable when it can be written on the form: dy dx = g(x)h(y), (1.1) where g is a function of x only and h is a function of y only. Method 1.1.1 To solve the ODE (1.1), we proceed as follows: • Bring all terms involving x to one side, and all terms involving y and dy to the other side. • Integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables (dont forget an arbitrary constant). • Solve the resulting equation for y(x). When it is clear from the context, we may sometimes write y′ to denote dy dx. Example 1.1.1 Solve the following equation (x ̸= 0): x3y′ = e3y. 1 We can separate the variables because y′ = dy dx; this gives e−3y dy = 1 x3 dx. By integrating, we obtain e −3y 3 = 1 2x2 + C. Thus, y = −1 3 ln \f \f \f \f 3 2x2 + ˜C\f \f \f \f , where ˜C ∈ R. Example 1.1.2 Solve the diﬀerential equation: dy dx = 2x(y2 + 1). We rewrite the equation to separate the variables x and y: 1 y2 + 1 dy = 2x dx. Now, if we integrate both sides of the latter equation, we obtain arctan(y) = x2 + C, where C ∈ R. To solve for y, we take the tangent of both sides to obtain y = tan(x2 + C), where C ∈ R is an arbitrary constant. 1.2 Linear ﬁrst-order equations First-order linear diﬀerential equations are the most interesting because we encounter them in physics (electricity, mechanics, etc.). These are equations where y and y′ are of the ﬁrst degree. Deﬁnition 1.2.1: First-order linear diﬀerential equations The general form is: a(x)y′ + b(x)y = c(x), (1.2) where a, b, and c are functions of x. When a(x) ̸= 0, then equation (1.2) is said to be normalized. In this case, (1.2) reduces to the equation: 2 y′ + p(x)y = q(x), (1.3) where p(x) = b(x) a(x) and q(x) = c(x) a(x) . If c(x) = 0 (equivalently q(x) = 0), then the equation obtained will be homogeneous, called a homogeneous linear equation. Method 1.2.1 To solve (1.3) using the integrator factor method, we proceed as follows: • We compute the integrating factor: µ(x) = e ∫ p(x) dx (Don’t worry about arbitrary constants here). • Multiply the equation (1.3) by the integrating factor. • Observe that, by the product rule, the left-hand side of the resulting equation can be rewritten as d dx [µ(x)y(x)], thus giving you the equation: d dx [µ(x)y(x)] = µ(x)q(x). • Integrate both sides of your last equation with respect to x, and solve for y(x). Don’t forget the arbitrary constant. Note that to obtain the expression for the integrating factor µ(x), we use the requirement that: d dx [µ(x)y(x)] = µ dy dx + dµ dx y = µ dy dx + µp(x)y. This means that µ must satisfy the simple diﬀerential equation: dµ dx = µp(x). Example 1.2.1 Solve the following equation: x dy dx + 2y = 10x2. For x ̸= 0, we rewrite the equation in standard linear form: dy dx + 2 x y = 10x. (1.4) This is now in the form: dy dx + p(x)y = q(x), 3 where p(x) = 2 x and q(x) = 10x. The integrating factor µ(x) is given by: µ(x) = e∫ p(x) dx = e∫ 2 x dx = x2. Now, we multiply the diﬀerential equation (1.4) by µ(x) = x2 to obtain: x2 dy dx + 2xy = 10x3. The left-hand side can be written as the derivative of a product: d dx (x2y) = 10x3. Now, if we integrate both sides with respect to x: ∫ d dx ( x2y) dx = ∫ 10x3 dx, we obtain x2y = 5x4 2 + C, where C ∈ R. That is y = 5x2 2 + C x2 , x ̸= 0 where C ∈ R is an arbitrary constant. 1.3 Second-order linear homogeneous equations with con- stant coeﬃcients Deﬁnition 1.3.1: Homogeneous second-order ODE We call second-order linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation a ODE of the form: Ly := ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0, where a, b, and c are real constants. To solve this type of equation, we assume a solution of the form: y(x, r) = erx, where r is a constant to be determined. Substituting this expression for y(x) into the diﬀerential equation gives the corresponding characteristic equation: ar2 + br + c = 0. Solving this quadratic equation yields two possible values for r: r1 = −b + √b2 − 4ac 2a , r2 = −b − √ b2 − 4ac 2a . 4 Depending on the discriminant ∆ = b2 − 4ac, we consider the following cases: (a) Distinct real roots: If r1 and r2 are two distinct real values, then the general solution to the diﬀerential equation is: y(x) = c1er1x + c2er2x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. (b) Repeated real roots: If r1 = r2, then the roots are real and equal, and the general solution is: y(x) = c1er1x + c2xer1x. Wait a moment! In this case, we initially obtain only one solution, y(x) = e r1x. But how do we derive the second term, c2xer1x? To understand this, consider the function: y(r, x) = e rx. When the linear diﬀerential operator L is applied to y(r, x), we have: Ly(r, x) = a(r − r1)2e rx. Now, take the partial derivative of y(r, x) with respect to r, and evaluate it at r = r1: L [∂y ∂r (r, x) ] r=r1 = [ 2a(r − r1)e rx + a(r − r1) 2xe rx] r=r1 . At r = r1, this expression simpliﬁes to: L [ ∂y ∂r (r, x)] r=r1 = 0. This demonstrates that the derivative: [∂y ∂r (r, x) ] r=r1 = xe r1x is also a valid solution to the diﬀerential equation. (c) Complex roots: If r1 and r2 are complex conjugates, i.e., r1 = α + iβ and r2 = α − iβ, where α and β are real constants, the general solution to the diﬀerential equation can be written as: y(x) = c1e(α+iβ)x + c2e(α−iβ)x. Using Euler’s formula e (α±iβ)x = e αx[cos(βx) ± i sin(βx)], the solution can also be expressed as: y(x) = C1eαx cos(βx) + C2e αx sin(βx), where C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants. This form is typically preferred in practice since it involves real-valued functions. 5 Example 1.3.1 Solve the following diﬀerential equations: 1. y′′ − 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 − 9 = 0 b) Solving for r: r2 = 9 ⇒ r = ±3 c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1e 3x + c2e −3x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 2. y′′ + 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 + 9 = 0 b) Solving for r: r2 = −9 ⇒ r = ±3i c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1 cos(3x) + c2 sin(3x), where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 3. y′′ + 6y′ + 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 + 6r + 9 = 0 b) Factorizing: (r + 3)2 = 0 ⇒ r = −3 c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1e −3x + c2xe−3x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 4. y′′ + 6y′ − 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 + 6r − 9 = 0 b) Solving using the quadratic formula: r = −6 ± √ 62 − 4(1)(−9) 2(1) = −3 ± 3 √2 c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1e(−3+3 √2)x + c2e (−3−3 √2)x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 6 1.4 Second-order Euler equations Deﬁnition 1.4.1 A second-order Euler equation is a type of diﬀerential equation written as: x2y′′ + αxy′ + βy = 0, where α, and β are constants. To solve this equation, we guess a solution of the form: y(x) = xr, where r is a number we need to ﬁnd. Then, we substitute this guess into the equation and solve for r. We obtain: {r(r − 1) + αr + β}xr = 0. This simpliﬁes to the characteristic equation: f (r) = r2 + (α − 1)r + β = 0. The solutions for r are: r± = 1 − α ± √ (α − 1)2 − 4β 2 . Case 1: Distinct real roots (∆ > 0) If ∆ = (α − 1) 2 − 4β > 0, the roots r1 and r2 are distinct real numbers. The general solution is: y(x) = c1xr1 + c2xr2. If either r1 or r2 is negative, the solution |y| → ∞ as x → 0. Case 2: Repeated roots (∆ = 0) If ∆ = 0, there is only one root r1. In this case, the solution is: y(x) = c1xr1. To ﬁnd a second independent solution, we proceed as above. We write L[xr] = (r − r1) 2er ln x. If we diﬀerentiate with respect to the parameter r, and evaluate it at r = r1, we obtain: [ L [ ∂ ∂r xr]] r=r1 = [ ∂ ∂r L[xr] ] r=r1 = 0. So, [ ∂ ∂r (xr) ] r=r1 = xr1 ln x is also a solution. This leads to the general solution: y(x) = (c1 + c2 ln x)xr1, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. Finally, using the Wronskian test, we can prove that the two solutions are linearly independent. 7 Case 3: Complex roots (∆ < 0) If ∆ = (α − 1) 2 − 4β < 0, the roots are complex: r± = 1 − α 2 ± i √ 4β − (α − 1)2 2 . Let λ = 1−α 2 and µ = √ 4β−(α−1)2 2 . The solution becomes: y(x) = xλ (A1 cos(µ ln x) + A2 sin(µ ln x)) . If x < 0, replace x with |x|. Example 1.4.1 Solve the following diﬀerential equations: 1. x2y′′ + xy′ − 9y = 0. We assume the solution in the form y = xr, and plug it into the diﬀerential equation: x2 d2 dx2 (xr) + x d dx (xr) − 9 (xr) = 0. Now, applying the derivatives, we get: x2 [r(r − 1)xr−2] + x [ rxr−1] − 9xr = 0. Simplifying further: r2xr − rxr + rxr − 9xr = 0. This simpliﬁes to: r2 − 9 = 0. Solving for r, we get: r = ±3. Thus, the general solution to the diﬀerential equation is: y(x) = c1x3 + c2x−3, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 2. x2y′′ − 3xy′ + 4y = 0, y(1) = 1, y′(1) = 0. Assume a solution of the form y = xr. Substituting into the diﬀerential equation: r(r − 1)xr−2 − 3rxr−1 + 4xr = 0. 8 Multiplying through by x2, we get: r(r − 1) − 3r + 4 = 0, which simpliﬁes to: r2 − 4r + 4 = 0. Factoring, we get: (r − 2) 2 = 0. Thus, r = 2 is a double root. The general solution to the diﬀerential equation is: y(x) = c1x2 + c2x2 ln x. Now, using the initial conditions y(1) = 1 and y′(1) = 0: From y(1) = 1, we get: c1 · 1 2 + c2 · 1 2 ln(1) = 1 ⇒ c1 = 1. To ﬁnd c2, we compute y′(x): y′(x) = d dx ( c1x2 + c2x2 ln x) = 2c1x + c2 (2x ln x + x) . Evaluating at x = 1: y′(1) = 2c1 + c2 (2 · 1 · ln(1) + 1) = 2c1 + c2 = 0. Substituting c1 = 1, we get: 2 + c2 = 0 ⇒ c2 = −2. Thus, the solution is: y(x) = x2 − 2x2 ln x. If x < 0, we replace x by |x|. 9 Chapter 2 Series solutions of variable coeﬃcient ordinary diﬀerential equations In this part, we introduce a method to solve linear diﬀerential equations with variable coeﬃcients, which frequently arise in physical problems. They do not usually admit solutions expressible in terms of elementary functions. Such equations can often be solved using numerical methods, but in many cases, it is easier to ﬁnd solutions in the form of an inﬁnite series. We introduce the concepts of ordinary points about which Taylor series solutions are obtained and singular points about which more general solutions are required. 2.1 Power series method The power series method is the standard method for solving linear ODEs with variable coeﬃcients. It gives solutions in the form of power series. These series can be used for computing values, graphing curves, proving formulas, and exploring properties of solutions, as we shall see. In this section we begin by explaining the idea of the power series method. Deﬁnition 2.1.1: Power series A power series (in powers of x − x0 ) is an inﬁnite series of the form ∞∑ n=0 an (x − x0) n = a0 + a1 (x − x0) + a2 (x − x0) 2 + · · · (2.1) Here, x is a variable. a0, a1, a2, · · · are constants, called the coeﬃcients of the series. x0 is a constant, called the center of the series. In particular, if x0 = 0, we obtain a power series in powers of x ∞∑ n=0 anxn = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · · (2.2) We shall assume that all variables and constants are real. 10 Example 2.1.1 Familiar examples of power series are the Taylor-Maclaurin series 1 1 − x = ∞∑ m=0 xm = 1 + x + x2 + · · · (|x| < 1, geometric series ) ex = ∞∑ m=0 xm m! = 1 + x + x2 2! + x3 3! + · · · cos x = ∞∑ m=0 (−1) mx2m (2m)! = 1 − x2 2! + x4 4! − + · · · sin x = ∞∑ m=0 (−1) mx2m+1 (2m + 1)! = x − x3 3! + x5 5! − + · · · . More generally, if we know all the derivatives of a function f (x) at a single point x0, then we have the Taylor approximation: f (x) = ∞∑ k=0 f (k) (x0) k! (x − x0) k , for x near x0. We note that the term ”power series” usually refers to a series of the form (2.1) [or (2.2)] but does not include series of negative or fractional powers of x. We use m as the summation letter. Before moving further, we review relevant properties of power series. Deﬁnition 2.1.2: Convergence of a power series The power series (2.1) is said to converge for a given x if the limit lim N →∞ N∑ n=0 an(x − x0) n exists. Otherwise, the series diverges for the given x. For any power series (2.1), exactly one of the following statements is true: (a) The power series converges only for x = x0. (b) The power series converges for all values of x. (c) There is a positive number R such that the power series converges if |x − x0| < R and diverges if |x − x0| > R. In case (c), R is called the radius of convergence of the power series. For convenience, we include the other two cases in this deﬁnition by setting R = 0 in case (a) and R = ∞ in case (b). The open interval of convergence is deﬁned as: (x0 − R, x0 + R) if 0 < R < ∞, or (−∞, ∞) if R = ∞. If R is ﬁnite, no general statement can be made about convergence at the endpoints x = x0 ± R. The series may converge at one or both endpoints, or diverge at both. 11 Theorem 2.1.1: Ratio test Consider the series ∑∞ n=0 cn and suppose: lim n→∞ \f \f \f \fcn+1 cn \f \f \f \f = L. (a) If L < 1, then ∑∞ n=0 cn converges. (b) If L > 1 or the limit approaches ∞, then ∑∞ n=0 cn diverges. (c) If L = 1, the ratio test is inconclusive, and another test must be used. Example 2.1.2 1. Find the radius of convergence for the following series: ∞∑ n=0 n!xn. Here, cn = n!xn. Using the ratio test, lim n→∞ \f \f \f \fcn+1 cn \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f(n + 1)!xn+1 n!xn \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞(n + 1)|x| = ∞ for all x ̸= 0. Thus, the series converges only at x = 0, so R = 0. 2. Find the radius of convergence for the following series: ∞∑ n=1 (−1)nxn n! . Here, cn = (−1)nxn n! . Using the ratio test, lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f cn+1 cn \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f xn+1/(n + 1)! xn/n! \f \f \f \f = |x| lim n→∞ 1 n + 1 = 0 for all x. Hence, R = ∞. 3. Find the radius of convergence for the following series: ∞∑ n=0 2 n n2 (x − 1) n. Here, cn = 2n n2 (x − 1)n. Using the ratio test, lim n→∞ \f \f \f \fcn+1 cn \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f2 n+1(x − 1) n+1/(n + 1)2 2n(x − 1)n/n2 \f \f \f \f = 2|x − 1| lim n→∞ n2 (n + 1)2 = 2|x − 1|. The series converges when 2|x − 1| < 1, or |x − 1| < 1 2. Thus, R = 1 2. 12 4. Find the radius of convergence for the following series: ∞∑ m=0 (−1)m 8m x3m. Here, cn = (−1)m 8m x3m. Using the ratio test, lim n→∞ \f \f \f \fcn+1 cn \f \f \f \f = |x| 3 8 . The series converges when |x|3 8 , or |x| < 2. Thus, R = 2. Idea of the power series method The idea of the power series method for solving ODEs is simple and natural. We describe the practical procedure and illustrate it for two ODEs whose solution we know, so that we can see what is going on. Important! For a given ODE P (x)y′′ + Q(x)y′ + R(x)y = 0, (2.3) we ﬁrst represent P (x), Q(x) and R(x) by power series in powers of x (or of x − x0 if solutions in powers of x − x0 are wanted). Next we assume a solution in the form of a power series with unknown coeﬃcients, y = ∞∑ m=0 amxm = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · · (2.4) and insert this series and the series obtained by termwise diﬀerentiation, y′ = ∞∑ m=1 mamxm−1 = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + · · · (2.5) y′′ = ∞∑ m=2 m(m − 1)amxm−2 = 2a2 + 3 · 2a3x + 4 · 3a4x2 + · · · (2.6) into the ODE. Then we collect like powers of x and equate the sum of the coeﬃcients of each occurring power of x to zero, starting with the constant terms, then taking the terms containing x, then the terms in x2, and so on. This gives equations from which we can determine the unknown coeﬃcients of (2.4) successively. Remark 2.1.1 Note that if the power series (2.4) has a positive radius of convergence R, then the radius of convergence of all its successive derivative series is also R. 13 Let us show this for three simple ODEs that can also be solved by elementary methods, so that we would not need power series. Example 2.1.3 1. Solve the following ODE by power series: y′ + 2y = 0. By substituting (2.4) and (2.5) into the ODE, we get: ∞∑ m=1 mamxm−1 + 2 ∞∑ m=0 amxm = 0. To obtain the same general power on both series, we let s = m − 1 (i.e. m = s + 1) in the ﬁrst series and s = m in the second. This gives . This gives: ∞∑ s=0 (s + 1)as+1xs + 2 ∞∑ s=0 asxs = 0. Combining terms, we have: ∞∑ s=0 [(s + 1)as+1 + 2as] xs = 0. For this equation to hold, we must have: (s + 1)as+1 + 2as = 0. Thus, we derive the recurrence relation: as+1 = − 2as s + 1 , s = 0, 1, 2, . . . Starting with a0 as arbitrary, we calculate the successive coeﬃcients: a1 = −2a0 1 , a2 = −2a1 2 = 2 2a0 2! , a3 = −2a2 3 = −2 3a0 3! . In general, the coeﬃcients are given by: as = (−1) s 2 sa0 s! . Substituting back into the power series, the solution becomes: y(x) = ∞∑ s=0 (−1) s 2 sa0 s! xs = a0 ∞∑ s=0 (−2x)s s! . 14 Recognizing the series for the exponential function, we have: y(x) = a0e−2x, where a0 is an arbitrary constant. 2. Solve the following ODE by power series: y′′ + y = 0. By inserting (2.4) and (2.6) into the ODE we have ∞∑ m=2 m(m − 1)amxm−2 + ∞∑ m=0 amxm = 0 To obtain the same general power on both series, we let s = m − 2 in the ﬁrst series and s = m in the second. This gives ∞∑ s=0 (s + 2)(s + 1)as+2xs + ∞∑ s=0 asxs = 0. Therefore, ∞∑ s=0 [(s + 2)(s + 1)as+2 + as] xs = 0. Hence (s + 2)(s + 1)as+2 + as = 0. This gives the recursion formula as+2 = − as (s + 2)(s + 1) (s = 0, 1, · · · ) We thus obtain successively a2 = − a0 2·1 = − a0 2! , a3 = − a1 3·2 = − a1 3! a4 = − a2 4·3 = a0 4! , a5 = − a3 5·4 = a1 5! and so on. a0 and a1 remain arbitrary. With these coeﬃcients the series becomes y = a0 + a1x − a0 2! x2 − a1 3! x3 + a0 4! x4 + a1 5! x5 + · · · . Reordering terms (which is permissible for a power series), we can write this in the form y = a0 ( 1 − x2 2! + x4 4! − + · · · ) + a1 ( x − x3 3! + x5 5! − + · · · ) 15 and we recognize the familiar general solution y = a0 cos x + a1 sin x, a0, a1 ∈ R. 2. Solve the following ODE by power series: y′ = 2xy We insert (2.4) and (2.5) into the given ODE, obtaining 1 · a1x0 + ∞∑ m=2 mamxm−1 = 2x ∞∑ m=0 amxm = ∞∑ m=0 2amxm+1 Now, to get the same general power on both sides, we make a ”shift of index” on the left by setting m = s + 2, thus m − 1 = s + 1. Then am becomes as+2 and xm−1 becomes xs+1. Also the summation, which started with m = 2, now starts with s = 0 because s = m − 2. On the right we simply make a change of notation m = s, hence am = as and xm+1 = xs+1; also the summation now starts with s = 0. This altogether gives a1 + ∞∑ s=0 (s + 2)as+2xs+1 = ∞∑ s=0 2asxs+1. Every occurring power of x must have the same coeﬃcient on both sides; hence a1 = 0 and (s + 2)us+2 − 2as or as+2 = 2 s + 2 as For s = 0, 1, 2, · · · we thus have a1 = 0, a2 = (2/2)a0, a3 = (2/3)a1 = 0, a4 = (2/4)a2, · · · . Hence a3 = 0, a5 = 0, · · · and for the coeﬃcients with even subscripts, a2 = a0, a4 = a2 2 = a0 2! , a6 = a4 3 = a0 3! , · · · ; a0 remains arbitrary. Hence, y = a0 ( 1 + x2 + x4 2! + x6 3! + x8 4! + · · · ) = a0e x2, a0 ∈ R. Remark 2.1.2 Note that we do not need power series method for these or similar ODEs? We used them just for explaining the idea of the method. What happens if we apply the method to an ODE not of the kind considered so far, even to an innocent-looking one such as y′′ + xy = 0 (”Airy’s equation”)? We most likely end up with new special functions given by power series. 16 2.2 Power series solution of general variable coeﬃcient lin- ear ODE In the last section we saw that the power series method gives solutions of ODEs in the form of power series. 2.2.1 Homogeneous case We consider solving the following variable linear ODE of the form P (x)y′′ + Q(x)y′ + R(x)y = 0. (2.7) If we divide the latter equation by P (x), we obtain Ly := y′′ + p(x)y′ + q(x)y = 0, (2.8) where p(x) = Q(x)/P (x) and q(x) = R(x)/P (x). In order to calculate the higher derivatives of y(x) to substitute into Taylors formula, we rewrite (2.8) as follows: y′′ = −p(x)y′ − q(x)y If y(x0) and y′(x0) are given, then y′′(x0) can be obtained directly from the ODE. Higher derivatives of y can, in turn, be obtained by diﬀerentiating the ODE repeatedly. This process will be successful provided p(x) and q(x) are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable at x = x0. In this case, p(x) and q(x) are said to be analytic at x0 and have Taylor expansions of the form: p(x) = p0 + p1(x − x0) + · · · = ∞∑ k=0 pk(x − x0) k q(x) = q0 + q1(x − x0) + · · · = ∞∑ k=0 qk(x − x0)k Note that in the power series method we can diﬀerentiate, add, and multiply power series, in a ”suitable sense”. For example: consider two power series ∞∑ m=0 am (x − x0) m and ∞∑ m=0 bm (x − x0)m . Then the series obtained by multiplying each term of the ﬁrst series by each term of the second series and collecting like powers of x − x0 is ∞∑ m=0 (a0bm + a1bm−1 + · · · + amb0) (x − x0)m = a0b0 + (a0b1 + a1b0) (x − x0) + (a0b2 + a1b1 + a2b0) (x − x0)2 + · · · . Ordinary points and singular points 17 Deﬁnition 2.2.1: Ordinary points and singular points The expansion point x0 is said to be an ordinary point of (2.8) if p(x) = Q(x)/P (x) and q(x) = R(x)/P (x) are analytic at x0. Otherwise, x0 is a singular point. Important! If x0 is an ordinary point, it is possible to obtain power series expansions of the solution y(x) of the form: y(x) = ∞∑ n=0 cn(x − x0) n (2.9) and to substitute the latter expansion (2.8) and solve for the unknown coeﬃcients cn in order to determine a solution. In addition, (2.9) converges at least on the open interval (x0 − R, x0 + R), where R is the the distance from x0 to the nearest singular point of (2.8). More precisely, the radius of convergence of (2.9) is at least as large as the radius of convergence of each of the series expansions for p(x) = Q(x)/P (x) and q(x) = R(x)/P (x), i.e., up to the closest singularity to x0. Example 2.2.1: Singular point An example of singular point: when P , Q, and R are polynomials and P (x0) = 0 while Q(x0) ̸= 0 or R(x0) ̸= 0, then x0 is a singular point. Another example is when: p(x) = √ x, q(x) = 2, then x0 = 0 is a singular point because p(x) is not diﬀerentiable at x = 0. Observations • If P , Q, and R are polynomials, then a point x0 such that P (x0) ̸= 0 is an ordinary point. • If x0 = 0 is an ordinary point, then we assume: y = ∞∑ n=0 cnxn, y′ = ∞∑ n=1 cnnx n−1, y′′ = ∞∑ n=2 cnn(n − 1)xn−2. The substitution into the ODE 0 = Ly gives: 0 = ∞∑ n=2 cnn(n − 1)xn−2 + ( ∞∑ n=0 pnxn) ( ∞∑ n=1 ncnxn−1) + ( ∞∑ n=0 qnxn) ( ∞∑ n=0 cnxn) . Re-indexing the powers of x, this results in: ∞∑ m=0 {(m + 2)(m + 1)cm+2 + (p0(m + 1)cm+1 + · · · + pmc1) + (q0cm + · · · + qmc0)} xm = 0. This yields a non-degenerate recursion formula for the cm. At an ordinary point x0, we can obtain two linearly independent solutions of the form (2.9). 18 Example 2.2.2 Find the power series in x for the general solution of (1 + 2x2)y′′ + 6xy′ + 2y = 0 (2.10) Here, we rewrite the given equation as: (1 + 2x2)y′′ + 6xy′ + 2y = y′′ + 2x2y′′ + 6xy′ + 2y = 0. Since x0 = 0 is an ordinary point of (2.10), we assume the general solution in the form of a power series: y = ∞∑ n=0 anxn, which will generate two linearly independent solutions. Now, diﬀerentiating y: y′ = ∞∑ n=1 nanxn−1, y′′ = ∞∑ n=2 n(n − 1)anxn−2. Substituting these into the diﬀerential equation: ∞∑ n=2 n(n − 1)anxn−2 + 2x2 ∞∑ n=2 n(n − 1)anxn−2 + 6x ∞∑ n=1 nanxn−1 + 2 ∞∑ n=0 anxn = 0, we can express the equation as: ∞∑ n=2 n(n − 1)anxn−2 + ∞∑ n=2 2n(n − 1)anxn + ∞∑ n=1 6nanxn + ∞∑ n=0 2anxn = 0. Reindexing the sums, we get: 2a2+6a3x+ ∞∑ n=4 n(n−1)anxn−2+ ∞∑ n=2 2n(n−1)anxn+6a1x+ ∞∑ n=2 6nanxn+2a0+2a1x+ ∞∑ n=2 2anxn = 0. Reindexing further: 2a2+6a3x+ ∞∑ n=2(n+2)(n+1)an+2xn+ ∞∑ n=2 2n(n−1)anxn+6a1x+ ∞∑ n=2 6nanxn+2a0+2a1x+ ∞∑ n=2 2anxn = 0. Next, we collect like terms: (2a2 + 2a0) + (6a3 + 8a1)x + ∞∑ n=2 [ (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + (2n2 + 4n + 2)an] xn = 0. Equating the coeﬃcients of powers of x, we get the recurrence relations for an: a2 = −a0, a3 = −4 3a1, an+2 = − 2(n + 1)2 (n + 1)(n + 2) an = −2(n + 1) (n + 2) an, n = 2, 3, 4, . . . . 19 Substituting n = 2, 3, 4, . . . into the recurrence relations: a4 = −3 2 a2 = 3 2a0, a5 = −8 5 a3 = 32 15a1, a6 = −5 3 a4 = −5 2a0, a7 = −12 7 a5 = −128 35 a1, . . . Thus, the general solution is: y = a0 ( 1 − x2 + 3 2 x4 − 5 2 x6 + · · · ) + a1 (x − 4 3 x3 + 32 15x5 − 128 35 x7 + · · · ) . This is the power series in x for the general solution of equation (2.10). Since P (x) = 1 + 2x2 has no real zeros, then every solution of equation (2.10) is deﬁned on (−∞, ∞). 2.2.2 Non-homogeneous case Deﬁnition 2.2.2: Ordinary point and singular point Let y′′ + p(x)y′ + q(x)y = f (x). (2.11) We say that x0 is an ordinary point of equation (2.11) if p(x), q(x), and f (x) are all analytic at x0. Otherwise, x0 is a singular point. Theorem 2.2.1 Let x0 be an ordinary point of (2.11). Let R be the distance from x0 to the nearest singular point of (2.11). Then every solution of (2.11) can be represented by a power series: y = ∞∑ n=0 an(x − x0) n (2.12) that converges at least on the open interval (x0 − R, x0 + R). Furthermore, (2.12) will generate the two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous part of (2.11) and a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous part of (2.11). Example 2.2.3 Find the power series in x for the general solution of y′′ + xy′ + y = 1 1 − x. (2.13) The series for 1 1−x is given by: 1 1 − x = ∞∑ n=0 xn, which converges on (−1, 1). Since x = 0 is an ordinary point, Theorem 2.2.2 says we will 20 generate both the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous solutions of (2.13) from: y = ∞∑ n=0 anxn, y′ = ∞∑ n=1 nanxn−1, y′′ = ∞∑ n=2 n(n − 1)anxn−2. Substituting these into (2.13), we get: ∞∑ n=2 n(n − 1)anxn−2 + x ∞∑ n=1 nanxn−1 + ∞∑ n=0 anxn = ∞∑ n=0 xn. Reindexing the sums, we obtain: 2a2 + ∞∑ n=1(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2xn + ∞∑ n=1 nanxn + a0 + ∞∑ n=1 anxn = 1 + ∞∑ n=1 xn. Collecting like terms: (2a2 + a0) + ∞∑ n=1 [(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + (n + 1)an] xn = 1 + ∞∑ n=1 xn. Equating coeﬃcients, we ﬁnd: a2 = 1 2(a0 − 1), an+2 = − an (n + 2)(n + 1) + 1 (n + 2)(n + 1) , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . Substituting n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., we ﬁnd: a3 = −1 3 a1 + 1 6 , a4 = −1 4 a2 + 1 12 = 1 8 a0 − 1 24, a5 = −1 5 a3 + 1 20 = 1 15a1 + 1 60, . . . Thus, the general solution is: y = a0 ( 1 − 1 2x2 + 1 8 x4 + · · · )+a1 ( x − 1 3x3 + 1 15x5 + · · · )+ ( 1 2 x2 + 1 6x3 − 1 24x4 + 1 60x5 + · · · ) . This is the power series in x for the general solution of Equation (2.13), deﬁned on (−1, 1). 21","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
