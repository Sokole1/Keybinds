Recently, increased gas prices and rumours of connections between their CEO and Big Oil have led to increased scrutiny. Some claim that their pumps are intentionally cheating customers by shortchanging them at the pump. (That is, if the pump says it has pumped one litre of gas, the actual amount dispensed is less than that.) The CEO denies this and states that while the pumps’ output is subject to random fluctuations, every litre purchased from one of their pumps produces a quantity of gas that is normally dis- tributed with mean 1; she does not say what the variance is. Each such quantity is independent and identically distributed. To test this hypothesis, an independent investigator goes to a number of Gastown Gas pumps and purchases a litre of gas 10000 times. The investigator measures each dispensed quantity and publishes the results (which are completely accurate) in the file gasquantities.mat. A second investigator, independently of the first, does the same and publishes the results in the file gasquantities2.mat. (a) Using Octave, compute the sample mean X and sample variance S? of each data set. Down- load the data files gasquantities.mat and gasquantities2.mat from the course webpage and put them in your working directory. Then you can use the commands import scipy.io mat = scipy.io.loadmat(’gasquantities.mat’) a = mat[\"gasquantities\"] [0] to load the data from the first investigator and save it as an array called a. Similarly, you can load the second dataset and save it as a different array. Submit your code and your computed sample means and sample variances.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
