The time T' (in hours past noon) until the arrival of the first taxi has Exponential(5) distribution, and the time B until the first bus is independent with Exponential(3) distribution. (a) Write down the joint probability density function of T and B. (b) Find the probability that the first taxi arrives before the first bus. () If you arrive at noon and take the first bus or taxi (whichever arrives first), what s the distribution of your waiting time (give the name and parameter(s))?
