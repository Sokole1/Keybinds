The number e = 2.718281828459045... is formally deﬁned as e = lim n→∞ ( 1 + 1 n )n . A person who knew the formula for the limit but was not sure what the actual value of e was decided to ﬁgure it out by computing en = ( 1 + 1 n )n for a few large values of n, and increase n until convergence to a speciﬁc number was identiﬁed. That person performed their computations on the IEEE 754 double precision ﬂoating point system, and this was the output: n en 102 2.704813829421528 104 2.718145926824926 108 2.718281798347358 1016 1.000000000000000 1032 1.000000000000000 The person was puzzled by the results, and speciﬁcally, by what seemed to be a rather dramatic and abrupt change of value of en for very large values of n. Explain what went wrong here from a numerical computa- tion point of view and why the ﬁrst three approximations in the above table are reliable in this case while the approximations for the two largest values of n are wrong on this ﬂoating point system. Make sure to explain speciﬁcally what breaks down in the numerical process. 2. Suppose that in the execution of a certain algorithm, we are faced with the need to approximately compute many times numbers of the form log2(n). Here n may be a large integer. Recall that x = log2(n) if 2x = n. In our scenario, we have a fast and robust way at our disposal of using the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and the power operation y = ax where a is an integer, but we do not have a fast way to compute a logarithm directly. Therefore, we seek an iterative method to approximate x = log2(n). (a) Recall that Newton’s method for solving an equation of the form f (x) = 0 is given by xk+1 = xk − f (xk) f ′(xk) , k = 0, 1, 2, . . . and it requires an initial guess, x0. Suggest an eﬃcient iterative formula based on Newton’s method to compute log2(n). Write the formula in a way that is suitable for numerical computations. You may assume that your initial guess is close enough to the value we are trying to compute. If it helps, the derivative of the function r(x) = 2x is r′(x) = 2x ln(2), and you may assume that the value ln(2) = 0.6931... is known to you ahead of time. (b) What is the convergence order of the formula you derived in part (a)? Explain. (c) Why is there no point in this case (from a computational point of view) to consider applying the secant method instead? Recall that this method is based on approximating f ′(x) by a ﬁnite dif- ference approximation that involves only the function values and not the derivative. There is no need to write down the formula; just answer the question in a few short sentences 3. The Householder reﬂector H = I − 2uuT , where the vector u satisﬁes ∥u∥2 = 1, is an eﬀective tool for solving linear least-squares problems and other problems. Prove that H is perfectly conditioned, i.e., its condition number is equal to 1: κ2(H) = 1. Show all your steps. Do not rely on any general arguments - you are being asked to provide a full and detailed answer here. 4. (a) The singular value decomposition (SVD) is expensive to compute in general, but suppose we happen to have computed it for some purpose for a square nonsymmetric nonsingular matrix A, and we are now in need of computing a solution of the linear system Ax = b. Suppose A is n × n. If A = U ΣV T is the SVD, write down the solution of the linear system in terms of U, Σ, V and b. (b) How many ﬂoating point operations would it take to compute the solution using the numerical procedure of (a)? (That is, assum- ing that the singular value decomposition of A is already given.) State your answer in big-O terms. Justify your answer brieﬂy. 5. (a) State one advantage and one disadvantage that the QR decompo- sition approach for solving linear least-squares problems has over the normal equations. (b) State one advantage and one disadvantage that the power method has over the inverse power method for computing an eigenpair of a matrix. 6. At times when a matrix A is ill-conditioned and we need to solve a linear system Ax = b, a common approach is to regularize it and solve instead (A + αI)y = b. Here α is a small positive scalar. If it is small enough, then the solution y would be close enough to x and at the same time solving for A + αI may be more numerically stable than solving for A. Suppose that A is symmetric positive of size n × n and its eigenvalues are λ1 > λ2 ≥ λ3 ≥ · · · ≥ λn−1 > λn > 0. As a reminder, the condition number of a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix is given by the ratio between its largest and smallest eigenvalue; in this case it would be κ2(A) = λ1 λn . (a) Write down a formula for the condition number of A+αI, namely κ2(A + αI), in terms of eigenvalues of A and α, and show that A + αI is better conditioned than A for any positive α. (b) Given the same matrix A and its eigenvalues as in part (a), sup- pose that we have decided to use an iterative method for solving (A + αI)y = b. Suppose that it is known that all the diagonal elements of A are equal to 1. Suppose also that it is known that all eigenvalues of A are larger then 2. State a condition on α for the convergence of the Jacobi scheme for any initial guess, in terms of one or more of the eigenvalues of A.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
