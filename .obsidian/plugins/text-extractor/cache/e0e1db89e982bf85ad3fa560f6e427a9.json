Here are three different parametrizations of the semi-circle z2 + y? = r2, y>0. ¢ The first uses the polar angle 8 as the parameter. We have already seen, in Example 1.0.1, the parametrization Y rcosf, rsinf i B2 yt=r? ( ’ ) r1(9)=(rc059,r51n9) ) peoEr A 7 * The second uses z as the parameter. Just solving z2 +y? =2,y > 0 for y as a function of z, gives y(z) = v'r2 — =% and so gives the parametrization Y (w, Vr2— x2) kg r(@) = (@, Vi %) —r<z<r T e The third uses arc length from (r, 0) as the parameter. We have seen, in Example 1.1.6, that the arc length from (7, 0) to r1(8) is just s = r6. So the point on the semicircle that is arc length s away from (r,0) is v S (rcos?, rsin?) r3(s) =11 (;) 22 +y? =1 ( s . s) = (rcos—, rsin — T T m 0<s<ar We shall see that, for some purposes, it is convenient to use parametrization by arc length. Here is a messier example in which we reparametrize a curve so as to use the arc length as the parameter.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
