Please check the submission day/time on Canvas. §1.1, §1.2, §1.3, §1.4 1 Written problems 1. (1.1.4 revised) Solve dy dx = 1 x2 − 1 , for y(0) = 0. Find its maximal interval of existence. 2. (1.1.102) Solve x ′ = 1 x2 , x(1) = 1. 3. (1.2.3) Sketch slope ﬁeld for y′ = y2. 4. (1.2.5) Is it possible to solve the equation y′ = y√ |x| for y(0) = 0? Is the solution unique? Justify. 5. (§1.2) Find at least two solutions y1(t) and y2(t) of y′(t) = 2y1/2, y(0) = 0, for t ≥ 0. Explain why the existence of two solutions of the given problem does not contradict the uniqueness part of Theorem 1.2.1. 6. (1.3.3) Solve dx dt = (x2 − 1)t, for x(0) = 0. 7. (1.3.4) Solve dx dt = x sin(t), for x(0) = 1. 8. (1.4.8) Solve 1 x2 + 1 y′ + xy = 3 with y(0) = 0. The solution is expressed using a deﬁnite integral which cannot be evaluated. 9. (1.4.102) Solve y′ + 2 sin(2x)y = 2 sin(2x), for y(π/2) = 3. 10. (1.4.103) Suppose a water tank is being pumped out at 3 L/min. The water tank starts at 10 L of clean water. Water with toxic substance is ﬂowing into the tank at 2 L/min, with concentration 20 t g/L at time t. When the tank is half empty, how many grams of toxic substance are in the tank (assuming perfect mixing)? 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
