Consider the following initial value problem (I.V.P.): { y′ = x + xy2, y(−1) = 0. (1) (a)(1 points) Prove that the solution to the I.V.P. (1) exists and is unique for y(−1) = 0. Solution: Solution: Note that both f (x, y) = x + xy2 and ∂yf (x, y) = 2xy are deﬁned and continuous for all x ∈ R, hence near (−1, 0). By Picard’s theorem (or theorem of existence and uniqueness) there exists an unique solution near (−1, 0). (b)(5 points) Find the explicit solution to the I.V.P. (1) and the open interval of existence of the solution. Solution: It is easy to see that y′ = x(1 + y2). Then ∫ dy 1 + y2 = ∫ x dx, that is: arctan(y) = x2 2 + C. Since y(−1) = 0, then arctan(0) = 1 2 + C, that is, C = − 1 2 . So we have arctan(y) = x2−1 2 , therefore: y = tan( x2 − 1 2 ). x has to satisfy 0 ≤ x2 < π + 1, therefore the interval of existance containing the I.C. x = −1 is x ∈ (− √π + 1, √π + 1). Solution: y = tan( x2 − 1 2 ), for x ∈ (− √π + 1, √π + 1) (c)(4 points) Use Euler’s method to obtain on approximation of y(1), solution of the I.V.P. (1) at x=1. Use a constant step size h = 1. Solution: Euler’s algorithm writes, assuming (xk, yk) known, as: xk+1 = xk + h; yk+1 = yk + hf (xk, yk) = yk + 1 · xk(1 + y2 k). Then we have: k xk yk 0 -1 0 1 0 y1 = y0 + x0(1 + y2 0) = 0 + −1 = −1 2 1 y2 = y1 + x1(1 + y2 1) = −1 Solution: y(1) ≈ y2 = −1. October 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 3 of 5 2. A tank contains at time t = 0 min an initial volume V0 = 100 liters of pure water. A solution containing t gram/liter of salt is being poured into the tank at a constant inlet ﬂow rate Qin = 1 liter/min. At the same time, the solution ﬂows out of the tank at a constant outlet ﬂow rate Qout = 2 liter/min. Let V (t) be the volume in liters contained in the tank at time t minutes and let m(t) be the mass in grams of salt in the tank at time t minutes. (a)(2 points) How long will it take for the tank to be empty? Solution: V (t) veriﬁes the following I.V.P.: dV dt = Qin − Qout = −1, V (0) = V0 = 100 Integrating both sides of the equation and using the I.C., we obtain: V (t) = 100 − t. Therefore V (t) = 0 when t = 100 min. Solution: t = 100. (b)(6 points) Find the explicit solution to the following I.V.P veriﬁed by the mass of salt m(t): { dm dt + 2 100−t m(t) = t, m(0) = 0. (2) Solution: Equation (2) is linear, we therefore use the integrating factor technique. Let r(t) be the integrating factor, which veriﬁes: r(t) = e ∫ p(t) dt = e ∫ 2 100−t dt = e −2 log |100−t| = (100 − t) −2 Hence (100 − t)−2m(t) = ∫ t (100 − t)2 dt. We then have, using integration by parts: ∫ t (100 − t)2 dt = t 100 − t + log |100 − t| + C. Therefore: m(t) = t(100 − t) + (100 − t) 2 log |100 − t| + C(100 − t) 2. Since m(0) = 0, then 1002 · log(100) + C · 1002 = 0, that is, C = − log(100). Therefore, we get: m(t) = t(100 − t) + (100 − t)2 log | 100 − t 100 |. Solution: m(t) = t(100−t)+(100−t)2 log | 100 − t 100 |. (c)(2 points) What mass of salt will there be in the tank when 10 liters remain (calculator ready expression)? Solution: We know that 10 liters remain at time t = 90 minutes. Therefore the remaining mass of salt is: m(90) = 90 · 10 − 10 2 log(10). Solution: m(90) = 90·10+10 2 log( 1 10 ) = 900−100 log(10).

(a)(5 points) Find and classify (as stable or unstable using the phase diagram) all the critical points when a > 0. Solution: There are three critical points y = 0, y = √a and y = − √a when a > 0. We ﬁnd that y = 0 is unstable and y = ± √a is stable. (b)(3 points) Find and classify (as stable or unstable) all the critical points when a ≤ 0. Solution: When a ≤ 0 there is only one critical point at y = 0, which is stable. (c)(2 points) If a = 1 and y0 > 1, what is the long-time behavior of the solution to the diﬀerential equation with initial value y(0) = y0? That is, what is limt→∞ y(t)? Solution: The righthand side is negative, so the solution approaches the critical point at √a = 1. That is, limt→∞ y(t) = 1. October 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 5 of 5 4.(10 points) Find the explicit solution to the following initial value problem:    −2 sin(x 2) + 2y2 + 2xy dy dx = 0, y(√π) = 1. (3) Clearly show each step. Solution: We check if this equation is exact with M = −2 sin(x2) + 2y2 and N = 2xy, the partial derivatives are My = 4y and Nx = 2y so it is not exact. However, there is an integrating factor as a function of x since My − Nx N = 1 x is a function of x. That integrating factor solves u′ = u x so u = x. We then integrate u M = −2x sin(x2) + 2xy with respect to x to get F (x, y) = cos(x2) + x2y2 + A(y). Indeed, this works with A(y) = 0. So an implicit solution is cos(x 2) + x2y2 = C. Plugging in y = 1 and x = √π, we ﬁnd C = −1 + π so cos(x2) + x2y2 = −1 + π. Finally, we solve for y and take the positive root. Solution: y = 1 x √ −1 + π − cos(x2).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
