Stride Exercises for Oversizing Arrays Imagine we have a cache with the following parameters: « Total size of 8 KB (2% bytes) * 16 sets « 32-way set associativity « 512 totallines « 16 byte line size « LRU eviction policy To study our cache, we traverse a 8 KB array of uinté_t called A exactly 10000 times. We start each traverse at index 0 and then walk through the array with a stride size of 2 bytes. Assume that A is 8 KB~ aligned (i.e., perfectly aligned with respect to the cache) and that we make no memory accesses except to A, (Compute carefully on this problem. No partial credit is available within each part.) If A s exactly 8 KB in size, exactly how many misses will occur in our 10000 traversals? misses: | 1 [} If A s exactly 16 bytes (1 cache line) larger than 8 KB in size, what will be the set number (the index) of the last line in 4 (the new line)?

Beware of \"off by one\" errors on these twol A picture may help!) integer (-} If A is exactly 716 bytes (7 cache lines) larger than 8 KB in size, what will be the set number (the index) of the last line in A7 integer (-} Now, let A be exactly 192 bytes (12 cache lines) larger than 8 KB and repeat the original experiment. How many misses will occur in our 10000 traversals? (Don't forget that we are using LRU, what you learned on the previous two parts, and that some sets now have an extra line in them.) misses: | May use a formula with +, - * and round brackets e If we halve the cache's associativity by doubling the number of sets and then repeat the previous experiment, what impact would that have on the number of misses?
