Describe the meaning of each of these digits. What is the mantissa and what is the ezponent of a floating point number? Describe two instances when floating point errors may be magnified. The following identity is given: In(z — Va? —1) = —In(z + Va2 — 1). (a) Which of the above two (mathematically equivalent) expressions is more suitable for numerical computations if z > 1? Justify your answer. (b) Suggest a formula different from the above two that is at least as numerically stable as your answer for part (a) and is more likely to prevent an overflow.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
