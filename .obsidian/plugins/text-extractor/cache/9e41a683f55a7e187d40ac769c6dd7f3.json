Specify the domain of pa- rameters. (a) the plane through (1, 2, 1) perpendicular to the vector ⟨1, 2, 3⟩. (b) the plane through (1, 2, 1) parallel to the vectors ⟨0, 1, −3⟩ and ⟨−2, 0, 7⟩. (c) the surface S : x2 + 3y + 2z2 + 4 = 0. (d) the part of the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 16, x > 2 (use y, z as parameters). (e) the part of the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 16, z > −2 (use spherical coordinates). 2. Find an equation of the tangent plane of the surface S = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 : z3 = xy + yz + zx} at the point (1, 0, 1). 3. Exercise 16.6: 3, 8, 10, 14 https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/calculus_online/section16.06.html#exercises If you see “Not Found”, check if “#” in the address is replaced by “%23”. 4. Let S be the part of the cone z = 2 √x2 + y2, where 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ y ≤ x. Compute the surface integral ∫ ∫ S xzdS. 5. Let S be the surface given by the equation x2 + z2 = cos 2 y with 0 ≤ y ≤ π 2 . (a) Find an equation for the tangent plane to S at ( 1 2, π 4 , 1 2). (b) Compute the integral ∫ ∫ S sin y dS.
