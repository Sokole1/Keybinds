(4 points) In the solution of a certain time-dependent problem, a need arises to solve a sequence of m linear systems: Ax() =), i=1,...,m, where b() represents a right-hand side vector at time-step i. (Notice that there is no connection to powers here: (i) represents a superscript, not a power.) The matrix A does not change throughout. The right-hand sides become available one step at a time: one needs to solve Ax() =p® first, then Ax@ = b(2), and so on. For example, if mn = 3 this means that we will need to solve three linear systems successively, Ax(M) = b(l), Ax@) = b(2), and Ax®) = b®), The matrix A is known to be n x n and dense, where n is relatively large. The vectors b() and x@ are, accordingly, of sizes n. The number of right-hand sides, m, may also be large but it is not directly related to n. pts (a) Suggest a numerical procedure for efficiently solving this sequence of linear systems, using an algorithm based on Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting. There is no need to provide the fine details of the algorithm here - just state in each stage which algorithm is used and what it computes.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
