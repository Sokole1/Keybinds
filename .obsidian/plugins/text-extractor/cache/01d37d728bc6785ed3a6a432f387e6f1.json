These values were recorded: k 1 2 3 4 error for method 1 | 1/16 1/64 1/256 1/1024 error for method 2 | 1/2 1/4 1/16 1/256 If the apparent trend ‘cleanly’ continues, then @ method 1 converges quadratically and method 2 linearly; method 1 will converge faster @ method 1 converges linearly and method 2 quadratically; method 2 will converge faster @ both methods converge linearly @ both methods converge quadratically @ neither method will converge Ascher & Greif (UBC Computer Science) A First Course in Numerical Methods CPSC 302, Fall 2023 30/46 Your Answer: B","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
