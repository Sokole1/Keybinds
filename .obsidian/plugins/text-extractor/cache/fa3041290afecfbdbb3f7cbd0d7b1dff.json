For example, z(t) and y(t) may be the populations (in thousands) of foxes and coyotes in British Columbia, and they compete for similar food and resource. The parameter ¢ measures how much they harm each other. (a) Find the condition on ¢ such that the system has exactly 4 critical points O(0,0), P(1,0), Q(0,1), and R(zo,yo) with 2o > 0 and yo > 0. Find R. In the remaining questions we assume ¢ > 0 satisfies the condition in part (a). (b) Compute the Jacobian matrices at the four critical points. Show that O is always unstable. (c) (One species extinction.) Find the range of ¢ such that R is unstable. Show that, in this case, both P and @ are stable. This is the case that (almost) only one species will survive and the other species goes extinct. (d) (Co-existence.) Find the range of ¢ such that R is stable. Show that, in this case, both P and @ are unstable. This is the case that both species can live happily ever after.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
