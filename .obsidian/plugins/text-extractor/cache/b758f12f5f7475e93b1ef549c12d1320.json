Certain pairs of squares in this grid, always in different rows, are connected by either “snakes” (leading down) or “ladders” (leading up). Each square can be an endpoint of at most one snake or ladder. 100] 99 @@ 97 |96 97 91 8 |82 |88 |84 as Mbes 00 ; | 787776 h 61 J2 | 62 e | Al 70 60 < A 3 b1 F i 0L B LE ©F £ 38 3| @ ks B Bl 4@ AW 28]« [ ¥]7 @] W] A typical Snakes and Ladders board. Upward straight arrows are ladders; downward wavy arrows are snakes. You start with a token in cell 1, in the bottom left corner. In each move, you advance your token up to k positions, for some fixed constant k (like a dice roll). If the token ends the move at the top end of a snake, it slides down to the bottom of that snake. Similarly, if the token ends the move at the bottom end of a ladder, it climbs up to the top of that ladder. Describe and analyze an algorithm to compute the smallest number of moves required for the token to reach the last square of the grid.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
