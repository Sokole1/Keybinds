After collecting all kinds of fascinating data, the rover is now ready to transmit it back to Earth. This data consists of n fragments, where fragment ¢ contains b; bits. The Al built into the rover also assigns a usefulness wj to each fragment, based on how useful the information in that fragment will be to the NAnonesia Space Agency (NASA). Unfortunately the rover’s battery is depleting, it has not been able to find a power outlet, and so it only has enough energy left to transmit B bits of data. This means the rover may not be able to send all of its data before it runs out of battery. 1. [5 marks| First, consider the case where transmitting only a part of a data fragment is worthwhile. The usefulness of a partial data fragment will be proportional to how much of the fragment has been sent. For instance, if w; = 15, b; = 100 and the rover is able to send 50 bit of fragment ¢ before running out of battery, then the usefulness of that partial fragment will be 15 % 50/100 = 7.5. Describe a greedy algorithin that takes in the arrays by,...,b, and wi,...,w, and the integer B, and maximizes the usefulness of the data the rover will send back to Earth. You may describe your algorithm using either words or psendo-code. 2. |3 marks| Now, let us consider the case where transmitting only a part of a data fragment is equivalent to not sending anything at all for that data fragment (i.e. an incomplete fragment has no usefulness at all). Give a small example showing that your algorithm from question 1 will not always return an optimal solution","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
