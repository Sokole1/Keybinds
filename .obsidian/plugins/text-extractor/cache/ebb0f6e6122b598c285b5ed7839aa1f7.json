What can we say about the convergence of these methods: @ There is not enough information to determine convergence of Newton’s method and bisection @ Bisection will converge but Newton’s method is not defined because f’'(z*) =0 @ Newton’s method will convergence linearly and bisection quadratically @ Newton’s method will converge quadratically and bisection linearly @ Newton’s method will converge linearly and bisection linearly Ascher & Greif (UBC Computer Science) A First Course in Numerical Methods CPSC 302, Fall 2023 44 /46 Your Answer: E","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
