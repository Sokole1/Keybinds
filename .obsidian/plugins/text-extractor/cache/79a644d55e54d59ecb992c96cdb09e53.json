For the last 3, itâ€™s easier to use some of the results regarding how combining convex functions can yield convex functions; which can be found in the lecture slides. Hint for part 4 (logistic regression): this function may at first seem non-convex since it contains log(z) and log is concave, but note that log(exp(=)) = = is convex despite containing a log. To show convexity, you can reduce the problem to showing that log(1 + exp(z)) is convex, which can be done by computing the second derivative. It may simplify matters to note that {20y = L.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
