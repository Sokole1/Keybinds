The arclength of the segment indicated by the blue line is the (scalar) s(t + h) — s(t). Remark: as h approaches 0, the curve (if it's differentiable at ¢) starts to resemble a straight line, with the length of the vector r(t + h) — r(t) approaching the scalar s(t + h) — s(t). This step is crucial to understanding Lemma 1.1.4. Lemma 1.1.4. Let r(t) be a parametrized curve. a. Denote by T(t) the unit tangent vector to the curve at r(t) pointing in the direction of increasing t. If ' (t) # 0 then N r'(t) T(t) = - [r'(2)] b.
