Be concise: avoid spending valuable time on lengthy answers. (a) We said that PCA and k-means are trying to optimize the same objective function (sum of squared errors)? If we could find the optimal k-means clustering, why would it have a higher value of this objective function than PCA? (b) In what setting would we prefer to use ISOMAP over PCA? (c) What do we use the backpropagation algorithm for?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
