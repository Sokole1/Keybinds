On Day 1, two volumes are backed up. Day 2 adds one new volume and the new volume is backed up. Day 3 adds two more volumes for a total of five volumes. Only the two new volumes are backed up. An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. This means that the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data. For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved. Incremental backups are different from full backups, in which all the data in a storage volume copies each time a backup occurs. The full backup includes data that has not changed since the most recent backup.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
