Suppose an application sends data in messages of 628 bytes each. Further suppose that the layers of the protocol stack use headers of the size given in the following table (in bytes): The network has bandwidth of 10Mbps. Assume that the existence of headers is the only overhead in the system (packets are never lost, retransmitted, or delayed, and packets are sent back-to-back on the communication medium). What is the throughput achieved by this application? Provide your answer as a decimal number with 2 significant figures number (2 significant figures) Mbps @ What is the goodput achieved by this application? Provide your answer as a decimal number with 2 significant figures number (2 significant figures) Mbps @ What fraction of the network's resources will be used for application data? Provide your answer as a decimal number between 0 and 1 with 2 significant figures number (2 significant figures) o Now suppose that the application sends data in messages of 39 bytes each. The size of the headers is the same as above. What is the goodput achieved by this application?
