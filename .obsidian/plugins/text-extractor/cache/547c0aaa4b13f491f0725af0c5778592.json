November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 2 of 6 1. (a)(6 points) Use the method of undetermined coeﬃcients to ﬁnd a particular solution to the diﬀerential equation: y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 5 sin(x). (b)(7 points) Use the method of variation of parameters to ﬁnd a particular solution to problem: y′′ − y = 2e −x. November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 3 of 6 2.(7 points) Find a particular solution to the problem: y′′ − 3y′ = 2ex − 6x. Hint: You can use either method of undetermined coeﬃcients or variation of parameters. November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 4 of 6 3.(10 points) Use the Laplace transform to solve the following initial value problem: y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = δ(t − 1), y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 2.

(a)(5 points) Use the Laplace transform and convolution to ﬁnd the solution to x′′ + x = f (t) subject to initial value conditions x(0) = 0 and x′(0) = 3. Here f (t) is any function and your solution should be in terms of certain integrals of f (t). (b)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of f (t) = { t, if 0 ≤ t < 1, 2 − t, if t ≥ 1. .
