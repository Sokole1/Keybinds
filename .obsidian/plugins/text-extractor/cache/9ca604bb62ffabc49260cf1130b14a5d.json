Consider the curve given by ⃗r (t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t, t 2) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Compute ∫ C √z ds. Solution. The velocity is v = (−2 sin t, 2 cos t, 2t), with norm |v| = (4 sin2 t + 4 cos 2 t + 4t 2) 1/2 = 2(1 + t2) 1/2. The line integral is then ∫ C √ z ds = ∫ 2π 0 √t2 (2)(1 + t 2)1/2dt = 2 ∫ 2π 0 t(1 + t 2) 1/2dt which evalutes to 2 \f \f \f \f 2π 0 (1 + t 2) 3/2(2/3)(1/2) = 2 3 ( (1 + 4π2) 3/2 − 1 ) . 2. Let C be the line segment from (0, 3) to (2, 3). Compute ∫ C xe ydx + x2ydy. Solution. Parametrize the curve by ⃗r (t) = ⟨t, 3⟩, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2. Then dx = 1dt and dy = 0dt. Therefore, ∫ C xeydx + x2ydy = ∫ 2 0 te3dt = e3t 2/2 \f \f \f \f 2 0 = 2e3. 3. Evaluate the line integrals Ij = ∫ Cj (x + 2y) dx + x2 dy, j = 1, 2, where C1 is the line segment from (0, 0) to (4, 0), and C2 consists of line segments from (0, 0) to (2, 1) and from (2, 1) to (4, 0). Is I1 equal to I2? Solution. C1 is parametrized by ⃗r1(t) = (t, 0), 0 ≤ t ≤ 4. We have ⃗r ′ 1(t) = (1, 0) and I1 = ∫ 4 0 [ (t + 0) · 1 + t 2 · 0 ] dt = ∫ 4 0 t dt = [t 2/2 ]4 0 = 8. Page 1 Math 317 Homework 2 Solutions Name Parametrize the two line segments of C2 by ⃗r2(t) = (2t, t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and ⃗r3(t) = (2 + 2t, 1 − t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. We have ⃗r ′ 2(t) = (2, 1), ⃗r ′ 3(t) = (2, −1), and I2 = ∫ 1 0 [ (2t + 2t)2 + (2t) 21 ] dt + ∫ 1 0 [ (2 + 2t + 2(1 − t))2 + (2 + 2t) 2(−1)] dt = ∫ 1 0 4 dt = 4. We have I1 ̸= I2. (Thus ⃗F (x, y) = (x + 2y, x 2) is not conservative.) 4. Evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C z2dx + x2dy + y2dz, where C is the line segment from (1, 0, 0) to (−2, 1, 2). Solution. Parametrize C by ⃗r(t) = (1, 0, 0) + t(−3, 1, 2) = (1 − 3t, t, 2t), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. We have ⃗r ′(t) = (−3, 1, 2), and I = ∫ 1 0 ((2t)2 · (−3) + (1 − 3t) 2 · 1 + t2 · 2 ) dt = ∫ 1 0 [1 − 6t − t2] dt = [t − 3t 2 − 1 3 t 3]1 0 = −7 3 . 5. Evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r, where ⃗F = x̂ııı + y ̂ + yz ̂k and C is given by the vector function ⃗r(t) = cos t̂ııı + sin t̂ + t ̂k , 0 ≤ t ≤ π. Solution. We have ⃗r ′(t) = − sin t̂ııı + cos t̂ + 1 ̂k , and I = ∫ π 0 [(cos t)(− sin t) + sin t cos t + t sin t · 1] dt = ∫ π 0 t sin t dt = [−t cos t + sin t] π 0 = π. 6. Determine if ⃗F = ⟨x3, −y4⟩ is conservative or not. If conservative, ﬁnd a potential. Solution. Let F1 = x3, F2 = −y4. Then ∂1F2 = 0 = ∂2F1. This suggests that there Page 2 Math 317 Homework 2 Solutions Name is a potential of ⃗F . If ∇f = ⟨x3, −y4⟩, then ∂f ∂x = x3, ∂f ∂y = −y4. The ﬁrst equation implies f (x, y) = ∫ x3dx = 1 4x4 + g(y) for some function g(y). We use the second equation to determine g(y); ∂f ∂y = −y4 = g′(y) Hence, g(y) = ∫ −y4dy = − 1 5y5 + C, which yields f (x, y) = ∫ x3dx = 1 4x4 − 1 5y5 + C. 7. Determine if ⃗F = ⟨xey, ye x⟩ is conservative or not. If conservative, ﬁnd a potential. Solution. Let F1 = xey, F2 = ye x. Then ∂1F2 = ye x and ∂2F1 = xey so ∂1F2 ̸= ∂2F1. This shows that the given vector ﬁeld is not conservative, hence no such f may exist. 8. Suppose that a particle of mass M is ﬁxed at the origin (0, 0, 0) while a particle of mass m moves from (a, 0, 0) to (0, b, 0) along the ellipse (x/a) 2 + (y/b) 2 = 1 on the xy-plane under the gravitational force ⃗F(x, y, z) = − GM m |⟨x, y, z⟩|3 ⟨x, y, z⟩, where G is a constant. Compute the work done by the force. Solution. Method 1. Direct calculation. We can parametrize the curve by ⃗r (t) = ⟨a cos t, b sin t, 0⟩, 0 ≤ t ≤ π/2. Then ⃗F(⃗r (t)) · ⃗r ′(t) = − GM m (a2 cos2 t + b2 sin 2 t)3/2 ⟨a cos t, b sin t, 0⟩ · ⟨−a sin t, b cos t, 0⟩ therefore, the work is ∫ π/2 0 ⃗F(⃗r (t)) · ⃗r ′(t)dt = ∫ π/2 0 −GM m(b2 − a2) cos t sin t (a2 cos2 t + b2 sin 2 t)3/2 dt. From the substitution u = a2 cos 2 t + b2 sin 2 t, du = 2(b2 − a2) cos t sin t, Page 3 Math 317 Homework 2 Solutions Name we see that the above integral is equal to ∫ b2 a2 −GM m 2u3/2 du = GM mu−1/2\f \f \f \f b2 a2 = GM m ( 1 |b| − 1 |a| ) . Method 2. We use that ⃗F is conservative. We attempt to ﬁnd a potential ϕ for ⃗F. From ∂xϕ = − GM mx (x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 , = F1 we get ϕ = GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 + f (y, z) for some function f . We can check that ∂y GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 = −(1/2)(2y) GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 = F2 and ∂z GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 = −(1/2)(2z) GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)3/2 = F3 and so ∇ GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 = ⃗F(x, y, z), which means that ϕ(x, y, z) = GM m (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 is a potential. Thus, ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ϕ(0, b, 0) − ϕ(a, 0, 0) = GM m ( 1 |b| − 1 |a| ) . Page 4","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
