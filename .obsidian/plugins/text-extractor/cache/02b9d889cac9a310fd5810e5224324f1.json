Let’s build a reduction from SAT to 3-SAT (so we're solving SAT in terms of 3-SAT). We’ll map an instance I of SAT to an instance I’ of 3-SAT, working on one clause at a time. Importantly, for our reduction to work, I should be satisfiable if and only if I’ is satisfiable. 1. Suppose that I has a clause with one literal, say (z5). To obtain I’ from I, we want to replace this clause by one or more clauses, while ensuring that I is satisfiable if and only if I’ is. How can we do this? Hint: one variable can appear multiple times in a clause. 2. What if I has a clause with two literals, say (Za V z3)?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
