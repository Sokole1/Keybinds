(Dec 1998, Problem 3) Let S be the spherical cap which consists of the part of the sphere x2 + y2 + (z − 2)2 = 4 which lies under the plane z = 1. Let f (x, y, z) = (2 − z)(x2 + y2). Calculate ∫ ∫ S f (x, y, z)dS. 2. (Dec 1998, Problem 4) Let S be the part of the surface (x + y + 1) 2 + z2 = 4 which lies in the ﬁrst octant. Find the ﬂux of F downwards through S where F = xyˆi + (z − xy)ˆj. 3. (Dec 1998, Problem 5) Let D be the cylinder x2 + y2 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 5. Calculate the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld F = (x + xye z)ˆi + 1 2 y2ze zˆj + (3z − yzez)ˆk outward through the curved part of the surface of D. 4. (Dec 1998, Problem 6) Let S be the part of the surface z = 16 − (x2 + y2) 2 which lies above the xy plane. Let F be the vector ﬁeld F = x log(1 + z)ˆi + x(3 + y)ˆj + y cos zˆk. Calculate ∫ ∫ S ∇ × F · n dS where n is the upward normal on S. 5. (Dec 2017, Problem 2) Let r(t) = ( 1 3t 3, 1 2t2, 1 2t), t ≥ 0. Compute s(t), the arclength of the curve at time t. 6. (Dec 2017, Problem 5) Recall that if T is the unit tangent vector to an oriented curve with arclength parameter s, then the curvature κ and normal N are deﬁned by dT ds = κN. Moreover, the torsion τ and the binormal vector B are deﬁned by B = T × N, dB ds = −τ N. Show that dN ds = −κT + τ B. 7. (Dec 2017, Problem 6) Let a, b, c be constants and let F = (2bx2y2 − axz, 2ax3y − 3cz2, 2byz + x2) (a) Compute ∇ × F. (b) Find the values of a, b, c which make F conservative. (c) Using the values of a, b, c from the previous part, ﬁnd a potential for F. Page 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
