(b) A rational number can be written as p/q, where p and g > 0 are both integers. So using the base B = q with ¢ large enough but finite gives an exact floating point representation. Likewise, it can be seen that any floating point representation translates into a rational number. An irrational number such as 7 cannot be written this way, so no exact floating point representation is possible.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
