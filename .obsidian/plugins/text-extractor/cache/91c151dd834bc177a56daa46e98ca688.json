You are likely already familiar with these techniques, as they were introduced in Math 215, 255, and 256. We will brieﬂy review some of them. 1.1 Separable equations we say that a ﬁrst-order ODE is separable when it can be written on the form: dy dx = g(x)h(y), (1.1) where g is a function of x only and h is a function of y only. To solve the ODE (1.1), we proceed as follows: • Bring all terms involving x to one side, and all terms involving y and dy to the other side. • Integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables (don’t forget an arbitrary constant). • Solve the resulting equation for y(x). When it is clear from the context, we may sometimes write y′ to denote dy dx . Example 1.1.1. Solve the following equation (x ̸= 0): x3y′ = e 3y. We can separate the variables because y′ = dy dx ; this gives e −3y dy = 1 x3 dx. 1 By integrating, we obtain e−3y 3 = 1 2x2 + C. Thus, y = −1 3 ln \f \f \f \f 3 2x2 + ˜C\f \f \f \f , where ˜C ∈ R. Example 1.1.2. Solve the diﬀerential equation: dy dx = 2x(y2 + 1). We rewrite the equation to separate the variables x and y: 1 y2 + 1 dy = 2x dx. Now, if we integrate both sides of the latter equation, we obtain arctan(y) = x2 + C, where C ∈ R. To solve for y, we take the tangent of both sides to obtain y = tan(x2 + C), where C ∈ R is an arbitrary constant. 1.2 Linear ﬁrst-order equations First-order linear diﬀerential equations are the most interesting because we encounter them in physics (electricity, mechanics, etc.). These are equations where y and y′ are of the ﬁrst degree. The general form is: a(x)y′ + b(x)y = c(x), (1.2) where a, b, and c are functions of x. When a(x) ̸= 0, then equation (1.2) is said to be normalized. In this case, (1.2) reduces to the equation: y′ + p(x)y = q(x), (1.3) where p(x) = b(x) a(x) and q(x) = c(x) a(x). If c(x) = 0 (equivalently q(x) = 0), then the equation obtained will be homogeneous, called a homogeneous linear equation. To solve (1.3) using the integrator factor method, we proceed as follows: 2 • We compute the integrating factor: µ(x) = e∫ p(x) dx (Don’t worry about arbitrary constants here). • Multiply the equation (1.3) by the integrating factor. • Observe that, by the product rule, the left-hand side of the resulting equation can be rewritten as d dx [µ(x)y(x)], thus giving you the equation: d dx [µ(x)y(x)] = µ(x)q(x). • Integrate both sides of your last equation with respect to x, and solve for y(x). Don’t forget the arbitrary constant. Note that to obtain the expression for the integrating factor µ(x), we use the re- quirement that: d dx [µ(x)y(x)] = µ dy dx + dµ dx y = µ dy dx + µp(x)y. This means that µ must satisfy the simple diﬀerential equation: dµ dx = µp(x). Example 1.2.1. Solve the following equation: x dy dx + 2y = 10x2. For x ̸= 0, we rewrite the equation in standard linear form: dy dx + 2 xy = 10x. (1.4) This is now in the form: dy dx + p(x)y = q(x), where p(x) = 2 x and q(x) = 10x. The integrating factor µ(x) is given by: µ(x) = e ∫ p(x) dx = e ∫ 2 x dx = x2. Now, we multiply the diﬀerential equation (1.4) by µ(x) = x2 to obtain: x2 dy dx + 2xy = 10x3. 3 The left-hand side can be written as the derivative of a product: d dx ( x2y) = 10x3. Now, if we integrate both sides with respect to x: ∫ d dx (x2y) dx = ∫ 10x3 dx, we obtain x2y = 5x4 2 + C, where C ∈ R. That is y = 5x2 2 + C x2 , x ̸= 0 where C ∈ R is an arbitrary constant. 1.3 Second-order linear homogeneous equations with constant coeﬃcients Consider a second-order linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation of the form: Ly := ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0, where a, b, and c are real constants. To solve this type of equation, we assume a solution of the form: y(x, r) = e rx, where r is a constant to be determined. Substituting this expression for y(x) into the diﬀerential equation gives the corresponding characteristic equation: ar2 + br + c = 0. Solving this quadratic equation yields two possible values for r: r1 = −b + √b2 − 4ac 2a , r2 = −b − √ b2 − 4ac 2a . Depending on the discriminant ∆ = b2 − 4ac, we consider the following cases: (a) Distinct Real Roots: If r1 and r2 are two distinct real values, then the general solution to the diﬀerential equation is: y(x) = c1e r1x + c2e r2x, 4 where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. (b) Repeated Real Roots: If r1 = r2, then the roots are real and equal, and the general solution is: y(x) = c1e r1x + c2xe r1x. Wait a moment! In this case, we initially obtain only one solution, y(x) = e r1x. But how do we derive the second term, c2xe r1x? To understand this, consider the function: y(r, x) = e rx. When the linear diﬀerential operator L is applied to y(r, x), we have: Ly(r, x) = a(r − r1) 2erx. Now, take the partial derivative of y(r, x) with respect to r, and evaluate it at r = r1: L [ ∂y ∂r (r, x)] r=r1 = [2a(r − r1)erx + a(r − r1) 2xerx] r=r1 . At r = r1, this expression simpliﬁes to: L [∂y ∂r (r, x) ] r=r1 = 0. This demonstrates that the derivative: [∂y ∂r (r, x) ] r=r1 = xe r1x is also a valid solution to the diﬀerential equation. (c) Complex Roots: If r1 and r2 are complex conjugates, i.e., r1 = α + iβ and r2 = α − iβ, where α and β are real constants, the general solution to the diﬀerential equation can be written as: y(x) = c1e (α+iβ)x + c2e (α−iβ)x. 5 Using Euler’s formula e(α±iβ)x = eαx[cos(βx) ± i sin(βx)], the solution can also be expressed as: y(x) = C1e αx cos(βx) + C2eαx sin(βx), where C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants. This form is typically preferred in practice since it involves real-valued functions. Example 1.3.1. Solve the following diﬀerential equations: 1. y′′ − 9y = 0 a) If we let y = e rx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 − 9 = 0 b) Solving for r: r2 = 9 ⇒ r = ±3 c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1e3x + c2e−3x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 2. y′′ + 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 + 9 = 0 b) Solving for r: r2 = −9 ⇒ r = ±3i c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1 cos(3x) + c2 sin(3x), where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 3. y′′ + 6y′ + 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 + 6r + 9 = 0 b) Factorizing: (r + 3)2 = 0 ⇒ r = −3 6 c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1e−3x + c2xe −3x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 4. y′′ + 6y′ − 9y = 0 a) If we let y = erx, we obtain the characteristic equation: r2 + 6r − 9 = 0 b) Solving using the quadratic formula: r = −6 ± √ 62 − 4(1)(−9) 2(1) = −3 ± 3 √2 c) The general solution is: y(x) = c1e (−3+3 √2)x + c2e (−3−3√2)x, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 1.4 Second-order Euler equations A second-order Euler equation is a type of diﬀerential equation written as: x2y′′ + αxy′ + βy = 0, where α, and β are constants. To solve this equation, we guess a solution of the form: y(x) = xr, where r is a number we need to ﬁnd. Then, we substitute this guess into the equation and solve for r. We obtain: {r(r − 1) + αr + β}xr = 0. This simpliﬁes to the characteristic equation: f (r) = r2 + (α − 1)r + β = 0. The solutions for r are: r± = 1 − α ± √ (α − 1)2 − 4β 2 . 7 Case 1: Distinct Real Roots (∆ > 0) If ∆ = (α − 1)2 − 4β > 0, the roots r1 and r2 are distinct real numbers. The general solution is: y(x) = c1xr1 + c2xr2. If either r1 or r2 is negative, the solution |y| → ∞ as x → 0. Case 2: Repeated Roots (∆ = 0) If ∆ = 0, there is only one root r1. In this case, the solution is: y(x) = c1xr1. To ﬁnd a second independent solution, we proceed as above. We write L[xr] = (r − r1) 2e r ln x. If we diﬀerentiate with respect to the parameter r, and evaluate it at r = r1, we obtain: [L [ ∂ ∂r xr]] r=r1 = [ ∂ ∂r L[xr]] r=r1 = 0. So, [ ∂ ∂r (xr)] r=r1 = xr1 ln x is also a solution. This leads to the general solution: y(x) = (c1 + c2 ln x)xr1, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. Finally, using the Wronskian test, we can prove that the two solutions are linearly independent. Case 3: Complex Roots (∆ < 0) If ∆ = (α − 1) 2 − 4β < 0, the roots are complex: r± = 1 − α 2 ± i √4β − (α − 1)2 2 . Let λ = 1−α 2 and µ = √4β−(α−1)2 2 . The solution becomes: y(x) = xλ (A1 cos(µ ln x) + A2 sin(µ ln x)) . If x < 0, replace x with |x|. Example 1.4.1. Solve the following diﬀerential equations: 1. x2y′′ + xy′ − 9y = 0. We assume the solution in the form y = xr, and plug it into the diﬀerential equation: x2 d 2 dx2 (xr) + x d dx (xr) − 9 (xr) = 0. 8 Now, applying the derivatives, we get: x2 [ r(r − 1)xr−2] + x [ rxr−1] − 9xr = 0. Simplifying further: r2xr − rxr + rxr − 9xr = 0. This simpliﬁes to: r2 − 9 = 0. Solving for r, we get: r = ±3. Thus, the general solution to the diﬀerential equation is: y(x) = c1x3 + c2x−3, where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants. 2. x2y′′ − 3xy′ + 4y = 0, y(1) = 1, y′(1) = 0. Assume a solution of the form y = xr. Substituting into the diﬀerential equation: r(r − 1)xr−2 − 3rxr−1 + 4xr = 0. Multiplying through by x2, we get: r(r − 1) − 3r + 4 = 0, which simpliﬁes to: r2 − 4r + 4 = 0. Factoring, we get: (r − 2) 2 = 0. Thus, r = 2 is a double root. The general solution to the diﬀerential equation is: y(x) = c1x2 + c2x2 ln x. 9 Now, using the initial conditions y(1) = 1 and y′(1) = 0: 1. From y(1) = 1, we get: c1 · 1 2 + c2 · 1 2 ln(1) = 1 ⇒ c1 = 1. 2. To ﬁnd c2, we compute y′(x): y′(x) = d dx ( c1x2 + c2x2 ln x) = 2c1x + c2 (2x ln x + x) . Evaluating at x = 1: y′(1) = 2c1 + c2 (2 · 1 · ln(1) + 1) = 2c1 + c2 = 0. Substituting c1 = 1, we get: 2 + c2 = 0 ⇒ c2 = −2. Thus, the solution is: y(x) = x2 − 2x2 ln x. 10","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
