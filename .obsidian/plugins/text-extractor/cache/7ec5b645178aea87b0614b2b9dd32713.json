Solution 1 (using Laplace transform): Letting X(s) = L(x(t)) we get s2X − sx(0) − x′(0) = e−s X(s) = 1 s + e−s s2 Taking the inverse Laplace transform then yields x(t) = 1 + u (t − 1) (t − 1) = { 1, 0 < t < 1 t, t > 1 The graph is: 0 1 2 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.

Taking Laplace’s transform we get s 2X − 1 + X = e−πs − e−2πs X(s) = 1 1 + s2 + e−πs − e−2πs 1 + s2 so that x(t) = sin(t) + sin(t − π)u(t − π) − sin(t − 2π)u(t − 2π) =    sin(t), 0 < t < π sin(t) + sin(t − π), π < t < 2π sin(t) + sin(t − π) − sin(t − 2π), t > 2π =    sin(t), 0 < t < π 0, π < t < 2π − sin(t), t > 2π The graph is shown below. 0 5 10 15 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 3. Find a ﬁrst order system corresponding to the scalar equation and ﬁnd its general solution. (a) y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = 0. (b) t2y′′ − 4ty′ + 4y = 0, t > 0. (It general solution is of the form y(t) = c1t + c2t4.) Answer. (a) Let x1 = y and x2 = y′. We have x′ 1 = x2, x ′ 2 = −4x1 + 4x2. The general solution of y is yc(t) = c1e2t + c2e2t. It corresponds to ⃗xc(t) = (yc y′ c ) = c1 ( e2t 2e2t ) + c2 ( te2t (2t + 1)e2t ) (b) Let x1 = y and x2 = y′. We have x′ 1 = x2, x ′ 2 = − 4 t2 x1 + 4 t x2. Its general solution is ⃗xc(t) = ( yc y′ c ) = c1 (t 1 ) + c2 ( t4 4t3 ) 4. Find the general solution to the system x′ = Ax, where A is as speciﬁed below. Make sure to write the solution in purely real form. 2 (a) A = ( 1 0 −4 3 ) . Answer. The two eigenvalues are λ = 1, 3. The corresponding eigenvectors are ( 1 2 ) and ( 0 1 ) . So the general solution is x = a ( 1 2 ) e t + b ( 0 1 ) e 3t where a, b are arbitrary constants. (b) A = ( 1 −5 1 −3 ) . Answer. trace = −2, det = 2, so characteristic equation λ2+2λ+2 = 0 or (λ + 1)2+1 = 0 so that λ = −1 ± i. Now take λ = −1+i, the corresponding eigenvector v = ( x y ) satisﬁes ( 2 − i −5 1 −2 − i ) ( x y ) = 0. The second row reads x = (2 + i)y so that one of the eigenvalue/eigenvector pair is λ = −1 + i, v = ( 2 + i 1 ) ; the other is complex conjugate. Now expand: ve λt = ( (2 + i) eite−t eite−t ) = e −t ( 2 cos t − sin t + i (cos t + 2 sin t) cos t + i sin t ) so that the general solution is given by x = a Re (veλt) + b Im (veλt) , x(t) = {a ( 2 cos t − sin t cos t ) + b ( cos t + 2 sin t sin t )} e −t where a, b are arbitrary constants. (c) A =   1 0 0 −2 1 2 −2 −2 1   Answer. The characteristic equation is 0 = det (A − λI) = (1 − λ) det ( 1 − λ 2 −2 1 − λ ) = (1 − λ)[(λ − 1) 2 + 4] Thus λ = 1, 1 ± 2i. The corresponding eigenvectors are: • λ = 1 :   0 0 0 −2 0 2 −2 −2 0     x y z   = 0, so that x = z, x = −y so the eigenvector is v =   1 −1 1   . 3 • λ = 1 + 2i :   −2i 0 0 −2 −2i 2 −2 −2 −2i     x y z   = 0, so that the ﬁrst row reads x = 0 and the second row reads 2iy = 2z so that v =   0 1 i   . • λ = 1 − 2i : v =   0 1 −i   (i.e. complex conjugate). When λ = 1 + 2i, we compute ve λt = e t   0 e2it ie2it   = e t   0 cos (2t) + i sin(2t) − sin(2t) + i cos(2t)   . The general solution is therefore x = aet   1 −1 1   + be t   0 cos 2t − sin 2t   + cet   0 sin 2t cos 2t   . (d) A = ( −5 −3 3 1 ) (You can skip part (d) as it is from §3.7.) Answer. This problem is from §3.7, and is included for completeness. The characteristic equation is λ2 + 4λ + 4 = 0 ⇐⇒ (λ + 2)2 = 0 so there is a double eigenvalue λ = −2. The eigenvector satisﬁes ( −3 −3 3 3 ) ( x y ) = 0 (1) whose only solution, up to a constant multiple, is v = ( 1 −1 ) . So it’s a defective eigen- value! So we need to ﬁnd a vector w such that (A − λI)w = v. That is, we need to solve ( −3 −3 3 3 ) ( x y ) = ( 1 −1 ) . A solution is given by x = 1 3 , y = −2 3 . To summarize, v = ( 1 −1 ) , w = ( 1/3 −2/3 ) , and therefore the general solution is x = ave −2t + b (w + tv) e −2t for arbitrary constants a, b. 4 5. A 3 × 3 real matrix has three eigenvalues. One of them is λ1 = −1 and its corresponding eigenvector is v1 =   0 1 0   . Another is λ2 = 1 + i and its corresponding eigenvector is v2 =   1 2 i   . (a) What is the third eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector? (b) Find the general solution to x′ = Ax. (c) Find the solution to x′ = Ax subject to initial condition x (0) =   1 0 0   . Answer. (a) The third eigenvalue/eigenvector pair is the complex conjugate of the second, that is λ3 = 1 − i and v2 =   1 2 −i   . (b) In complex form, the general solution is x = a   0 1 0   e−t + b   1 2 i   et+it + c   1 2 −i   e t−it (c) Plugging in t = 0, we obtain a linear system to solve for a, b, c :   0 1 1 1 2 2 0 i −i     a b c   =   1 0 0   By inspection (or otherwise), the solution is b = c = 1/2, a = −2 so that x (t) = −2   0 1 0   e−t + e t    eit+e−it 2 2eit+2e−it 2 ieit−ie−it 2  |  = −2   0 1 0   e−t + et   cos t 2 cos t − sin t   . 5 MATH 215/255 Homework 7M Submit online via Canvas by 6pm, Wednesday, November 13, 2019 The MatLab part counts for 4 points M1.
