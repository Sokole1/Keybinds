For this reduction, show that I is a Yes-instance of Clique if and only if I’ is a Yes-instance of WC. Reduction: Given instance I = (G = (V, E), k) of Clique, where |V| = n and |E| = m, instance I' = (G’ = (V', E'), k') of WC is as follows. The set V' is V U Vg, where Vi = {u. | e € E} is a new set of m vertices, one per edge of G. There are two types of edges in E’: o Edges (v,ue), (z,u.) for each edge e = (v,z) of G. o Edges (ue,uy) for each pair of nodes u, and ue of Vg. Finally, we'll set k' = k +m. This completes our description of I’. (a) Show that if I is a Yes-instance of Clique, then I’ is a Yes-instance of WC. (b) Show that if I’ is a Yes-instance of WC, then I is a Yes-instance of Clique.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
