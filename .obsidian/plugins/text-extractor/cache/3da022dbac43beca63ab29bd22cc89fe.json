Suppose that Fy = 2N, the forcing function is Fysin(2t), (a) Determine for what values of the damping constant ¢ there will be no practical resonance. (b) Assume ¢ = 2Ns/m, find the practical resonance frequency and amplitude. Plot the solution for large ¢ (t — 00). (c) If ¢ vanishes, ie., ¢ = ONs/m, find the frequency w at which the response is strongest. For this w, find an expression for z(t), assuming that the motion starts at equilibrium, z(0) =0, 2/(0) = 0.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
