Given thatd | a and using the properties of the ged, we can infer that d | (a, b). But, it's given that (a, b) = 1, which means the only integer that divides both a and bis 1. This contradicts our assumption thatd > 1. Thus, our assumption that (¢, @) # Lisincorrect, whichimplies (c,a) = 1. Proof for () (¢, b) = 1: Similarly, assume for contradiction that (¢, b) # L.
