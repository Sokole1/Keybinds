The recurrence of the studentâ€™s algorithm is as follows: 2T(n/4) + T(3n/4) + cn?, ifn>2 T(n) = { . (1) c, ifn=1. 1. You want to get an upper bound on 7T'(n). Since the Master Theorem does not handle recurrences like this, with two terms involving 7'() on the right hand side, you decide to work with the following recurrence: T'(3n/4 2 ifn>2 T(n) < 3T(3n/4) + cn?, Tn_ @ c, ifn=1. Apply the Master Theorem to solve recurrence (2).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
