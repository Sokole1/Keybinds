Consider the following autonomous 2D system of DE’s: x′ = x(4 − αx − 2y), y′ = 2y(−3 + x), where α > 0. (3 pt) a) For what values of α there is a critical point in the interior of the ﬁrst quadrant (where x, y > 0)? Answer. x-nullclines and y-nullclines are obtained from F (x, y) = 0 and G(x, y) = 0 respec- tively. hence x-nullclines are x = 0, y = 2 − α 2 x (0.5pt) and y-nullclines are y = 0, x = 3 (0.5pt) The only critical point which is possible to place in the interior of the ﬁrst quadrant is the intersection of x = 3 and y = 2 − α 2 x. (1pt) Hence (x∗, y∗) = (3, 2 − 3 α 2 ). The critical point will be in the ﬁrst quadrant if y∗ > 0 or 2 − 3 α 2 > 0. Hence α < 4 3 (1pt) Suppose that α = 1 in the following questions. (2 pt) b) Find and sketch the nullclines of this system in positive (x, y). The x-nullcline is where x′ = 0. The y-nullcline is where y′ = 0. Answer. x-nullclines are x = 0, y = 2 − x 2 (0.25pt) and y-nullclines are y = 0, x = 3 (0.25pt) (1.5pt) for sketching the nullclines. 2 (2 pt) c) Determine the critical points. Answer. The critical points are (0, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0.5) Marking: (1 pt) for one critical point, (1.5 pt) for two critical points, and (2 pt) for two critical points. (7 pt) d) For each critical point ﬁnd the corresponding linear system. Classify each criti- cal point as to type, and determine whether it is asymptotically stable, stable, or unstable. Answer. The Jacobian matrix is A = ( 4 − 2x∗ − 2y∗ −2x∗ 2y∗ 2(x∗ − 3) ) (1pt) The ﬁrst critical point, (0, 0) A = ( 4 0 0 −6 ) , eigenvalues are r = 4 and r = −6. (1pt) Hence (0, 0) is a saddle point (unstable). (1pt) The second critical point, (4, 0) A = (−4 −8 0 2 ) , eigenvalues are r = −4 and r = 2. (1pt) Hence (4, 0) is a saddle point (unstable). (1pt) The third critical point, (3, 0.5) A = (−3 −6 1 0 ) , eigenvalues are r1,2 = − 3 2 ± i √15 2 . (1pt) Hence (3, 0.5) is spiral-in (asymptotically stable). (1pt) 3 (2 pt) e) Sketch trajectories in the neighborhood of the critical point which is in the interior of the ﬁrst quadrant (where x, y > 0). Answer. (1 pt) for sketching a spiral and (1 pt) for showing the direction of the spiral. -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Figure 0.1: Q1-part(b–e): x-nullclines and y-nullclines are shown by blue and red lines, respec- tively. 4 (6 pt) 2. a) Match the following DE with the direction ﬁeld. Explain why. (a) y′ = (1 − y)(y − 2) 2 (b) y′ = (1 − y)[(y − 2) 2 + 0.1] (c) y′ = (1 − y)[(y − 2) 2 − 0.1] ( i ) (i i ) (i i i ) Answer. (a) two critical points y = 1, y = 2 (ii) (2pt) (b) one critical points y = 1 (i) (2pt) (c) three critical points y = 1, y = 2 ± √ 0.1 (iii) (2pt) 5 (2 pt) b) Classify the equilibrium solutions (critical points) of: y′ = (1 − y)(y − 2) 2 as either stable, unstable or metastable/semistable. Answer. y = 1 (stable) (1pt) y = 2 (metastable) (1pt) (2 pt) c) What range of initial conditions results in solutions with t → ∞, y(t) → 1? What about t → ∞, y(t) → 2 ? Answer. if y(0) < 2, t → ∞, y(t) → 1 (1pt) if y(0) > 2, t → ∞, y(t) → 2 (1pt) (3 pt) d) Use partial fractions to ﬁnd the solution of the IVP: y′ = (1 − y)(y − 2)2, y(0) = 1.5 Answer. This DE is separable. Rewrite dy (y − 1)(y − 2)2 = −dt. (1pt) Partial fraction: A y − 1 + By + C (y − 2)2 = 1 (y − 1)(y − 2)2 Solving for A, B, and C, we have A = 1, B = −1, C = 3. Hence the DE can be written as, dy y − 1 − dy y − 2 + dy (y − 2)2 = −dt (1pt) Integrating LHS from y(0) = 1.5 to y(t) and RHS from 0 to t, we have ln 1 − y y − 2 − 1 y − 2 = −t + 2 (1pt) 6 3. Find the general solution for the following ﬁrst order DE. (5 pt) a) (3t 2x + 2tx + x3) + (t2 + x2)x′ = 0 Answer. The equation is not exact, but we can use an integrating factor r(t) to transform it to an exact DE. We have an exact equation M (t, x) + N (t, x)x′ = 0 with M = (3t 2x + 2tx + x3)r(t), N = (t 2 + x2)r(t). We need Mx = Nt, hence (3t 2 + 2t + 3x2 − 2t)r(x) = (t 2 + x2)r′(x). Thus r′ = 3r and r(t) = e 3t. (2pt) The solution is F (t, x) = C where Ft = (3t2x + 2tx + x3)e 3t, Fx = (t 2 + x2)e3t. (1pt) Then F = ∫ Fx dx = (t2x + x3 3 )e 3t + g(t) (0.5pt) Ft = 2txe3t + 3(t 2x + x3 3 )e 3t + dg(t) dt = (3t 2x + 2tx + x3)e3t dg(t) dt = 0 g = C (0.5pt) so that the solution is (t 2x + x3 3 )e3t = C (1pt) 7 (4 pt) b) tx′ − 2x = t 3e2t, (t > 0) Answer. Dividing the equation by t, we have x′ − 2 t x = t 2e 2t This is a linear ﬁrst order equation in the form of x′ + p(t)x = g(t). Hence it can be solved using the method of integrating factor. The integrating factor µ(t) is µ(t) = e− ∫ 2 s ds = t −2 (2pt) Then x(t) = ∫ t µ(s)g(s)ds + C µ(t) = ∫ t e2sds + C t−2 so that the solution is x(t) = t2 2 e2t + Ct 2 (2pt) 8 (3 pt) 4. a) Find the general solution of the equation 9y′′ + 6y′ + 4y = 0. Answer. The characteristic equation is 0 = 9r2 + 6r + 4 = 9r2 + 6r + 1 + 3 = (3r + 1)2 + 3. Hence 3r + 1 = ± √3i, and r = 1 3(−1 ± √3i). The general solution is yc(t) = c1e− 1 3 t cos (√3 3 t ) + c2e − 1 3 t sin (√3 3 t ) . (5 pt) b) Find a particular solution of y′′ − y′ − 2y = e2t. (1) Answer. The characteristic equation of the homogeneous equation is 0 = r2 − r − 2 = (r − 2)(r + 1). Hence r = −1, 2. Its general solution is yc(t) = c1e −t + c2e 2t.(1pt) A ﬁrst guess of a particular solution of (1) is yp(t) = ae 2t, which overlaps with yc. A revised guess is yp(t) = ate2t.(1pt) We have y′ p = a(2t + 1)e 2t, y′′ p = a(4t + 4)e2t, (1pt) hence y′′ p − y′ p − 2yp = 3ae2t = e2t.(1pt) Hence a = 1/3 and yp(t) = 1 3 te 2t .(1pt) Marking: full mark if correct ﬁnal yp without giving yc. 9 (8 pt) 5. Find the solution to the initial value problem y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 4t, y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 0. (2) Answer. The characteristic equation of the homogeneous equation is 0 = r2 + 2r + 2 = (r + 1)2 + 1, i.e., r = −1 ± i. Its general solution is yc(t) = c1e−t cos t + c2e −t sin t.(2pt) Since t 2 is a degree 2 polynomial, a ﬁrst guess of a particular solution of (2) is yp(t) = at + b, (1pt) which has no overlap with yc and is hence a good guess. We have y′ p = a, y′′ p = 0, and hence y′′ p + 2y′ p + 2yp = 0 + 2a + 2(at + b) = 2at + (2a + 2b) = 4t.(1pt) We get 2a = 4, 2a + 2b = 0, and hence a = 2, b = −2, yp = 2t − 2, (1pt) and the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation (2) is y(t) = yc(t) + yp(t) = c1e−t cos t + c2e −t sin t + 2t − 2.(1pt) y′(t) = c1e −t(− cos t − sin t) + c2e −t(cos t − sin t) + 2.(1pt) The initial conditions give c1 − 2 = 1, −c1 + c2 + 2 = 0. Hence c1 = 3, c2 = 1, and y(t) = 3e −t cos t + e −t sin t + 2t − 2.(1pt) 10 (3 pt) 6. a) Consider a spring-mass system without external force and friction described by mx′′ + kx = 0, with mass m > 0, spring constant k > 0, and x(t) is the deviation of the mass from its equilibrium position. Suppose the spring constant is k = 8 and the spring is oscillating with frequency of 2 hertz (i.e. 2 full periods per second). Determine the mass m of the spring. Answer. A general solution is x(t) = A cos( √ k m t + α) with natural (angular) fre- quency √ k m .(1pt) Since it oscillates 2 full periods per second, we have √ k m = 2π · 2 = 4π.(1pt) Thus m = k (4π)2 = 1 2π2 .(1pt) (5 pt) b) Consider a spring-mass system described by the initial value problem x′′ + cx′ + 9x = cos(3t), x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 2. (3) where c > 0 is the damping coeﬃcient. Find the steady periodic part of the solution (the part of the solution which remains as t → ∞) of this problem, and ﬁnd its amplitude as a function of c. Do not ﬁnd the transient part. Answer. Since c > 0, the general solution of xc(t) has exponential decay. A ﬁrst guess of a particular solution of (3) is yp(t) = a cos(3t) + b sin(3t), (1pt) which has no overlap with xc since both terms do not decay. We have x′ p = −3a sin(3t) + 3b cos(3t), x ′′ p = −9a cos(3t) − 9b sin(3t), (1pt) and hence x′′ p + cx′ p + 9xp = −3ac sin(3t) + 3bc cos(3t) = cos(3t).(1pt) We get a = 0, b = 1 3c , a xp = 1 3c sin(3t).(1pt) The amplitude is 1 3c.(1pt) 11 (2 pt) c) Let A(c) denote the maximum amplitude of the steady state solutions of the systems x′′ + cx′ + 9x = cos(ωt), x(0) = 0, x ′(0) = 2 among all possible ω > 0. What happens to A(c) as c → 0+? Explain why. Hint. You do not need to solve A(c) explicitly. Answer. By part (b), we have A(c) ≥ 1 3c . Thus A(c) → ∞ as c → 0+. 12 (5 pt) 7. a) Find the Laplace transform L[f (t)](s) of the function: f (t) =  | | 3, 0 ≤ t < 2, 3t + 2, 2 ≤ t < 4, 4t, t ≥ 4. Answer. First we write f (t) using the Heaviside function: f (t) = 3 + u(t − 2)(3t − 1) + u(t − 4)(4t − 3 − 3t + 1) = 3 + u(t − 2)(3t − 1) + u(t − 4)(t − 2) (2pt) We rewrite f (t) in the following form: f (t) = 3 + 3u(t − 2)(t − 2) + 5u(t − 2) + u(t − 4)(t − 4) + 2u(t − 4) (1pt) in order to use the second shifting property of the Laplace transform. Finally: L[f (t)] = F (s) = 3 s + e −2s ( 3 s2 + 5 s ) + e −4s ( 1 s2 + 2 s ) (2pt) (6 pt) b) Using the convolution, ﬁnd a formula for the solution of the initial value problem for a general bounded and continuous function h(t): y′′ + ω2y = h(t), y(0) = α, y′(0) = β with ω, α, β any real constants. Note: the formula for y(t) shall involve an integral. Answer. Applying Laplace transform on each side of the equation gives: s2Y (s) − sα − β + ω2Y (s) = L[h(t)] (1pt) Y (s) = β s2 + ω2 + sα s2 + ω2 + 1 s2 + ω2 H(s) (2pt) Finally using the convolution formula: y(t) = β ω sin ωt + α cos ωt + 1 ω ∫ t 0 h(t − τ ) sin ωτ dτ (3pt) 13 (7 pt) 8. Find the solution to the initial value problem: y′′ + 4y = 4 + δ(t − 3π), y(0) = 0, y′(0) = 1 Answer. Applying the Laplace transform on both sides of the equation gives: s2Y (s) − 1 + 4Y (s) = L[4] + L[δ(t − 3π)] (1pt) Y (s)[s2 + 4] = 1 + 4 s + e −3πs Y (s) = 4 s(s2 + 4) + 1 s2 + 4 + e−3πs s2 + 4 (3pt) Using a partial fraction decomposition: 4 s(s2 + 4) = 1 s − s (s2 + 4) (1pt) Using the table of Laplace transforms and the second shifting property we ﬁnally have: y(t) = 1 − cos 2t + 1 2 sin 2t + 1 2u(t − 3π) sin 2t (2pt) 14 (7 pt) 9. Solve the system of ODEs: ⃗x ′ = [ 3 1 −1 1 ] ⃗x Answer. Let P = [ 3 1 −1 1 ], det(P − λI) = (3 − λ)(1 − λ) + 1 = (λ − 2) 2. There is one repeated eigenvalue λ = 2. (1pt) The algebraic multiplicity of λ = 2 is 2. Setting (P −2I) ⃗v1 = [ 1 1 −1 −1 ] ⃗v1 = ⃗0, we can determine that the geometric multiplicity of λ = 2 is 1. (1pt) From the previous relation we have ⃗v1 = [ −1 1 ]. (1pt) The solution is of the form: ⃗x(t) = c1 ⃗v1e 2t + c2e 2t( ⃗v2 + ⃗v1t) (1pt) with (P − 2I) ⃗v2 = ⃗v1 (1pt). (P − 2I) ⃗v1 = [ 1 1 −1 −1 ] ⃗v2 = [ −1 1 ] We choose ⃗v2 = [ −1 0 ] (1pt) and ﬁnally: ⃗x(t) = c1 [ −1 1 ] e2t + c2 ([ −1 0 ] e2t + [ −1 1 ] te2t) (1pt) 15 10. We consider the non-homogeneous system: ⃗y ′ = [ 1 2 2 1 ] ⃗y + [ 2e4t e 4t ] , (5 pt) a) Find the fundamental matrix associated to the complementary solution. Answer. We determine the complementary solution ⃗x(t) = c1 ⃗x1(t) + c2 ⃗x2(t) = c1 ⃗v1e λ1t + c2 ⃗v2e λ2t. Let A = [ 1 2 2 1 ], det(A − λI) = (1 − λ)(1 − λ) − 4 = (λ + 1)(λ − 3). The two eigenvalues are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = −1. (1pt) Setting (A − 3I) ⃗v1 = [ −2 2 2 −2 ] ⃗v1 = ⃗0, we choose ⃗v1 = [ 1 1 ]. (1pt) Setting (A + I) ⃗v2 = [ 2 2 2 2 ] ⃗v2 = ⃗0, we choose ⃗v2 = [ 1 −1 ] . (1pt) The columns of the fundamental matrix Y (t) associated to the complementary so- lution are ⃗x1(t) and ⃗x2(t): Y (t) = [ e3t e−t e3t −e−t ] (2pt) 16 (6 pt) b) Find a particular solution of the system using the variation of parameters. Answer. We write the system: ⃗y ′ = A⃗y + ⃗f (t), We seek a particular solution of the form ⃗yp(t) = Y (t) ∫ Y −1(t)f (t)dt. We compute ﬁrst the inverse of Y (t): Y −1(t) = 1 det(X(t)) [ −e−t −e −t −e 3t e 3t ] = −1 2e2t [ −e −t −e −t −e3t e3t ] = [ 1 2e −3t 1 2e −3t et 2 −et 2 ] (2pt) Then: ∫ Y −1(t) ⃗f (t)dt = 1 2 [ ∫ 3e tdt∫ e5tdt ] = 1 10 [ 15et e 5t ] (2pt) Finally: ⃗yp(t) = Y (t) ∫ Y −1(t) ⃗f (t)dt = 1 10 [ e 3t e−t e 3t −e −t ] [ 15et e5t ] = 1 5 [ 8e 4t 7e 4t ] (2pt) 17 Extra page 1.
