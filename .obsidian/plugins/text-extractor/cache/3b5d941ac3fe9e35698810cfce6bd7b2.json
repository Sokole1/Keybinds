This is the gradient descent method with a fixed step size a. (a) If A = M — N is the splitting associated with this method, state what M and the iteration matrix 7 are. (b) Suppose A is symmetric positive definite and its eigenvalues are \\; > Ay > «++ > An > 0. i. Derive a condition on a that guarantees convergence of the scheme to the solu- tion x for any initial guess. ii. Express the condition on « in terms of the spectral condition number of A, K(A). iii. Show that the best value for the step size in terms of maximizing the speed of convergence is ) TN Find the spectral radius of the iteration matrix in this case, and express it in terms of the condition number of A. (¢) Determine whether the following statement is true or false. Justify your answer. “If A s strictly diagonally dominant and a = 1, then the iterative scheme converges to the solution for any initial guess xo.”","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
