Mapping Logical block numbers to Physical block numbers of Multi-level Indexes Consider a fle system that represents files using a multi-level index. Assume that it has a blocksize of 2048 and that disk addresses are 8 bytes. In this question, your job is to identify which locations in both the file system metadata and index blocks will need to be read to translate from a logical block number to a physical block number. Assume that allindices start at 0. If we have a multi-level index 1 pointer stored directly in the file metadata and a maximum of 4 levels of index blocks, and a file consisting of 256 blocks, indicate the index in each level that must be accessed to find the physical block number for logical block 103. Place a -1in any index level for any level that s undefined for this question. For example, the diagram below shows a system with 4-byte block pointers, 16-byte blocks, a maximum index level of 3, and 1 pointer in the metadata structure. We show the proper indices for two LBNs, 2 and 61. Note that for the file with 4 or fewer blocks, index blocks only exist at level 1. In cases like this, place a -10n levels that are not present.
