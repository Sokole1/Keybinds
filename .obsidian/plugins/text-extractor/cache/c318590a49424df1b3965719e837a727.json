Suppose that we parametrize S by using the spherical coordinate: T (¢,0) = (asingcosf,asinpsinb,acos¢g), 0< ¢ <, 0<6<2m. (a) Show that 95 x OpT (¢, 0) = asin g7 (¢,6). (b) Using the parametrization, verify that the area of S is 4ma?. (c) Compute the flux of F(z,y, z) = (z,y,0) across S by using the result from (a). (d) Compute the flux of f‘(z, y, z) = (,y,0) across S by using the divergence theorem.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
