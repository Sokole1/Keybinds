If we assume that the “instantaneous rate” that users quit using Windows depends on the features z; but not the total time that they’ve been using Windows, then a standard censored survival analysis likelihood is given by (Y, viles, w) = exp(viw” ;) exp(—y; exp(w’ z;)). (a) If a dataset consists of n IID examples (z;,y;, v;), show how finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for w corresponds to minimizing an additive loss function, n 1) = 3 o 1,0, i=1 and derive the form of the loss function f (simplifying as much as possible). (b) If the largest value of y; in the training set is k, what is the cost of evaluating this objective function in terms of n, d, and k? (c) Show that the function derived in part (a) is convex (you can assume y; > 0).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
