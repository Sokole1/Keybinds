Determining whether or not a generalized level of the Super Mario Brothers game can be successfully completed (Mario reaches the flag) is NP-hard. That is, if we refer to this decision problem as MARIO, then it is a fact that for any problem X in NP, X <, MARIO. (If you’re not familiar with the Super Mario Brothers game, no worries, this fact is all you need. Details of the game are irrelevant for completing this question.) 1. Let’s assume that P # NP. What can we conclude from the fact provided above? Check all that apply. [ ] 3D-Matching <, MARIO [ ] MARIO <, 3D-Matching 2. Again assume that P # NP. What can we conclude? Check all that apply. Note that the 2D matching problem (which is a decision version of the bipartite matching problem) is in P. [ ] 2D-Matching <, MARIO [ ] MARIO <, 2D-Matching 3. Finally, let’s consider what happens if P = NP. Again, based on the fact above, what can we conclude? Select all that apply.

The number of kindergartners that can attend school i is capped at C[i]. The family of each child has provided an unranked set of preferred schools. The Kindergarten Assignment problem is to determine whether all children can be assigned to one of their preferred schools, while ensuring that each school i is assigned at most C[i] kindergartners. Assuming that P # NP, is this problem in P or is it NP-complete?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
