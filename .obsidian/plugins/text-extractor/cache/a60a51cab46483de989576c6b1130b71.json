A physicist performs lab experiments and due to measurement errors a linear system Ay = c is obtained. It is known that [|b— c]| < a-||b]l, where a is a known positive scalar. (a) Show that the absolute error satisfies le = yll < o A7 - b, for any norm. 1 (b) Find an upper bound, expressed in terms of @ and the condition number of the matrix, £(A), on the relative error iz - yll llll","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
