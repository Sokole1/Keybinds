In the case 𝐹 ≡ 0 we know that a solution is of the form ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 𝑏 𝑛 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑥 𝐿 ) 𝑒 − 𝑛 2 𝜋 2 𝑘 𝑡 𝐿 2 in which the 𝑏 𝑛 are the coefficients in the Fourier sine expansion of 𝑓 on [ 0 , 𝐿 ] . For the non- homogeneous problem, we will take a cue from that case and attempt a solution 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 𝑇 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑥 𝐿 ) (2) The problem is to determine each 𝑇 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) . Part 11. By observing that, for a given 𝑡 , equation (2) can be interpreted as the Fourier sine expansion of 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) , considered as a function of 𝑥 , with 𝑇 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) being the 𝑛 th Fourier coefficient in this expansion, carefully establish the expression for 𝑇 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) . Answer: 𝑇 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) = 2 𝐿 ∫ 𝐿 0 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑥 𝐿 ) 𝑑 𝑥 Part 22. Now assume that for each 𝑡 ≥ 0 , 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) , as a function of 𝑥 , can also be expanded in a Fourier sine series: 𝐹 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 𝐵 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑥 𝐿 ) (3) where 𝐵 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) = 2 𝐿 ∫ 𝐿 0 𝐹 ( 𝜉 , 𝑡 ) sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝜉 𝐿 ) 𝑑 𝜉 (4) is the coefficient in this expansion, and may depend on 𝑡 .
