Let ⃗F(⃗x) = A⃗x, A =  a11 a12 a13 a21 a22 a23 a31 a32 a33  , where aij are real constants. (a) Find the condition on A so that ⃗F has a scalar potential. (b) Find the condition on A so that ⃗F has a vector potential. Solution. Firstly, observe that ⃗F is C 1 on R3. Therefore, • ⃗F has a scalar potential if any only if curl ⃗F = ⃗0, • ⃗F has a vector potential if any only if div ⃗F = 0. (a) Note that curl ⃗F = (a32 − a23, a13 − a31, a21 − a12). Thus, curl ⃗F = ⃗0 if and only if A is symmetric: aij = aji for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3. Therefore, if A is symmetric, then ⃗F has a scalar potential. (b) Note that div ⃗F = a11 + a22 + a33. So if a11 + a22 + a33 = 0, then ⃗F has a vector potential. 2. Show that the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = ⟨x − y, y − z, x − z⟩ does not have a vector potential. Solution. We compute div ⃗F = 1 + 1 − 1 = 1. We know that if ⃗F has a vector potential, then div ⃗F = 0. Since div ⃗F ̸= 0, it follows that ⃗F does not have a vector potential. 3. The vector ﬁeld ⃗F = ⟨x − y, y − z, x − 2z⟩ has a vector potential. Find a vector potential ⃗A = ⟨A1, A2, A3⟩ with A3 = 0. Solution. Suppose ⃗F = ∇ × ⟨A1, A2, 0⟩. We have −∂3A2 = F1 = x − y ∂3A1 = F2 = y − z ∂1A2 − ∂2A1 = F3 = x − 2z. From −∂3A2 = x − y we have the general solution A2 = ∫ (−x + y)dz = −xz + yz + f (x, y) for some function f of x, y variables. A solution to the second equation ∂3A1 = y − z is given by A1 = ∫ (y − z)dz = yz − z2/2. (Note: You may also work with the general solution A1 = yz − z2/2 + g(x, y) and choose an appropriate g(x, y) later. But we have seen that we can always choose g(x, y) to be 0.) Page 1 Math 317 Quiz 5 Practice Problems From the last equation we have ∂1(−xz + yz + f (x, y)) − ∂2(yz − z2/2) = −z + ∂1f (x, y) − z = x − 2z, so ∂1f (x, y) = x. By integrating x with respect to x, we get a solution to the above equation: f (x, y) = x2/2. This gives a vector potential ⃗A = (yz − 1 2z2, −xz + yz + 1 2x2, 0). 4. Let f, g be smooth scalar functions on R3 and ⃗F be a smooth vector ﬁeld on R3. Find the condition on ∇f and ∇g so that ∇ × (g∇f ) = ⃗0. Specify vector identities that you are using, but you are not required to justify them. Solution. By the product rule, ∇ × (g∇f ) = ∇g × ∇f + g∇ × (∇f ). Since ∇ × (∇f ) = ⃗0, it follows that ∇ × (g∇f ) = ∇g × ∇f. So ∇ × (g∇f ) = ⃗0 if and only if ∇g × ∇f = ⃗0 (happens when ∇g and ∇f are parallel). 5. Let S be the surface z = 2 + x2 − 3y2 and F = (xz + axy2, yz, z2). Consider the points P1 = (1, 1, 0) and P2 = (0, 0, 2) on the surface S. Find a value of the constant a so that∫ C1 F · dr = ∫ C2 F · dr for any two curves C1 and C2 on the surface S from P1 to P2. Solution. By Stokes’s theorem, ∫ C1 F · dr − ∫ C2 F · dr = ∫ ∫ R curl ⃗F · ˆndS, where R ⊂ S is the piece of the surface bounded by the two curves C1,C2. We must ﬁnd a such that this ﬂux integral is zero. We compute curl ⃗F = (−y, x, −2axy) and if z = f (x, y) = 2 + x2 − 3y2, then fx = 2x, fy = −6y, ˆndS = (−fx, −fy, 1) = (−2x, 6y, 1)dxdy, and so curl ⃗F · ˆndS = (2xy + 6xy − 2axy)dxdy = (8 − 2a)xy, and for this to be zero, we must choose a = 4. Page 2 Math 317 Quiz 5 Practice Problems 6. Let C be the intersection of the paraboloid z = x2 + y2 and the plane z = 2y + 3 oriented counterclockwise when observed from the point (0, 0, 100). Compute the line integral ∮ C ⃗F·d⃗r for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = ⟨−y3, x 3, −z3⟩. Solution. Let S be the part of the plane z = 2y + 3 = f (x, y) enclosed by C oriented upward. Then ∂S = C. By Stokes’ theorem, ∮ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ S curl ⃗F · ˆndS. We compute curl ⃗F = \f \f \f \f \f \f i j k ∂1 ∂2 ∂3 −y3 x3 −z3 \f \f \f \f \f \f = ⟨0, 0, 3x2 + 3y2⟩, ˆndS = ⟨−∂1f, −∂2f, 1⟩dxdy = ⟨0, −2, 1⟩dxdy. We parametrize S by ⃗r (x, y) = ⟨x, y, 2y + 3⟩, (x, y) ∈ D, where D is the projection of the surface S onto the xy-plane. To determine D, we look at ∂D, which is the projection of ∂S onto the xy-plane. Note that ∂S is the intersection of z = x2 + y2 and z = 2y + 3. So if (x, y, z) ∈ ∂S, then x2 + y2 = 2y + 3, or equivalently, x2 + y2 − 2y + 1 = 4. We can complete the square to get x2 + (y − 1) 2 = 4. Thus, we ﬁnd that ∂D is the circle x2 + (y − 1) 2 = 4 and thus, D = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : x2 + (y − 1)2 ≤ 4}. Therefore, ∫ ∫ S curl ⃗F · ˆndS = ∫ ∫ D⟨0, 0, 3x2 + 3y2⟩ · ⟨0, −2, 1⟩dxdy = 3 ∫ ∫ D(x2 + y2)dxdy. We change variables using polar coordinates; x = r cos θ, (y − 1) = r sin θ, or equivalently, x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ + 1 between the domains (x, y) ∈ D and (r, θ) ∈ [0, 2] × [0, 2π]. Then ∂(x, y) ∂(r, θ) = \f \f \f \f cos θ sin θ −r sin θ r cos θ \f \f \f \f = r, so we ﬁnd that dxdy = | ∂(x,y) ∂(r,θ) |drdθ = rdrdθ. By the change of variable formula, we get Page 3 Math 317 Quiz 5 Practice Problems ∫ ∫ D(x2 + y2)dxdy = ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 2 0 [(r cos θ) 2 + (r sin θ + 1)2]rdrdθ = ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 2 0 [r2 + 2r sin θ + 1]rdrdθ = 2π ∫ 2 0 [r2 + 1]rdrdθ = 2π(r4/4 + r2/2) \f \f \f \f 2 0 = 2π(4 + 2) = 12π. Combining all the computations above, we get ∮ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ S curl ⃗F · ˆndS = 3 ∫ ∫ D(x2 + y2)dxdy = 36π. 7. Let S be the portion of the ellipsoid x2 + 4y2 + z2 = 4 where z ≥ √ 3x. Suppose that S is oriented so that the unit normal vector at (0, 0, 2) is ⟨0, 0, 1⟩. Let ⃗F be a vector ﬁeld such that ∇ × ⃗F = ⟨− √ 3y2, −2zy, z2⟩. Use Stokes’ theorem to compute ∫∫ S(∇ × ⃗F ) · ˆndS. Solution. Let B be the part of the plane z = √3x enclosed by the ellipsoid x2+4y2+z2 = 4 oriented upward. We note that ∂B = ∂S, so by Stokes’ theorem, ∫ ∫ S(∇ × ⃗F ) · ˆndS = ∫ ∂S ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ B(∇ × ⃗F ) · ˆndS. We parametrize B with r(x, y) = ⟨x, y, √ 3x⟩, (x, y) ∈ D, where D is the projection of B onto the xy-plane. This gives ˆndS = ⟨− √ 3, 0, 1⟩dxdy. Next, we determine D. Note that ∂B is the intersection of x2 + 4y2 + z2 = 4 and z = √3x. By substituting z with √3x in the ﬁrst equation, we get x2 + y2 = 1. This shows that the projection of ∂B onto the xy-plane is the circle x2 + y2 = 1. Therefore, we ﬁnd that D = {(x, y) : x2 + y2 ≤ 1}. ∫ ∫ B(∇ × ⃗F ) · ˆndS = ∫ ∫ D⟨− √3y2, −2(√ 3x)y, (√ 3x)2⟩ · ⟨−√3, 0, 1⟩dxdy = ∫ ∫ D 3y2 + 3x2dxdy = ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 1 0 3r2rdrdθ = 3π 2 . Therefore, ∫∫ S(∇ × ⃗F ) · ˆndS = 3π 2 . Page 4 Math 317 Quiz 5 Practice Problems 8. Let f (t) be a function of 1-variable, and g(x, y, z) a function of 3-variables. Suppose we know g(1, 2, 3) = 4, ∇g(1, 2, 3) = (1, 0, 1), ∇ 2g(1, 2, 3) = 2. and f (4) = 1, f ′(4) = 2, f ′′(4) = 3. Let h(x, y, z) = f (g(x, y, z)) and evaluate ∇2h at the point (1, 2, 3). Solution. We start with ∂x[f (g(x, y, z))] = f ′gx and using the Chain rule again gives ∂x∂x[f (g(x, y, z))] = ∂x(f ′(g(x, y, z))gx(x, y, z)) = f ′′gxgx + f ′gxx. By symmetry, we have (∂x∂x + ∂y∂y + ∂z∂z)f (g(x, y, z)) = f ′′g2 x + f ′′g2 y + f ′′g2 z + f ′gxx + f ′gyy + f ′gzz. In vector calculus notation, this is ∇ 2f (g(x, y, z)) = f ′′|∇g| 2 + f ′∇ 2g. We now substitute (1, 2, 3) to obtain ∇ 2h(1, 2, 3) = (3)(12 + 02 + 12) + (2)(2) = 10. Page 5","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
