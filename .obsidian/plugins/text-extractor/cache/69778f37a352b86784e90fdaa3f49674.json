Now consider By sinh(4L) + kB cosh(uL) = 0, assume B # 0, we will get tanh(uL) = —. When 2 > 0 the left side always greater than 0, and the right side always less than 0 since x > 0. When < 0,a contradiction stil rises, making the equation invalid. Hence B = 0, and in this case, there is no non-trivial solutions helpfull |4","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
