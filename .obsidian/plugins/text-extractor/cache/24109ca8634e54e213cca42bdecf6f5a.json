The problem asks: Is there a vertex cover with at most K vertices in G? Here, a vertex cover is a subset W of V such that |[W| < K, such that every edge in E has at least one endpoint in W. e Dominating Set: An instance is a graph G = (V, F)) and an integer K. The problem asks: Is there a dominating set with at most K vertices in G? Here, a dominating set is a subset W of V' such that [W| < K, such that every element of V â€” W is joined by an edge to an element of W. 1. Give a reduction from Vertex Cover to Dominating Set. Explain why your reduction is correct, and runs in polynomial time.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
