(12 points) You run PCA with k = 2 on some (already centred) data set X (not shown) and arrive at 10 10 2 -2 0.5 0.5 —05 —0.5 Z=\\s 3| W’[M 01 0.7 0.1]' 4 3 Assume these results were generated with the standard implementation of PCA using SVD, where the principal components are orthonormal and ordered. (a) What is the first element of the reconstructed input matrix, namely &7 (b) If you had instead used k = 1, what would Z and W be? (Note: use the original k = 2 matrices for the remaining parts.) (c) The third and fourth rows of Z (above) are identical. Does this mean that the third and fourth rows of the training data matrix, X, are also identical (to each other, not to Z)? Briefly justify your answer.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
