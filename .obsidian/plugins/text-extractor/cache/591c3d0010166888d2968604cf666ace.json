In a small town in northern BC, there are n landlords with an apartment to rent, and n renters looking for a place to live. Each renter is willing to pay a di˙erent rent amount for each apartment (presumably one is willing to pay more money for a nicer apartment than for a shabby one), and would prefer a fancier apartment even though it's more expensive. a. [3 marks] De˝ne what it would be appropriate to call an instability in this situation. b. [5 marks] Describe an e˚cient algorithm to decide which renter will rent which apartment. 3. [8 marks] Using a recursion tree, give tight ( Θ) upper and lower bounds on the function T (n) de˝ned by the following recurrence relation: T (n) = { 4T (n/4) + 9T (n/9) + n1.5 if n ≥ 9 Θ(1) if n ≤ 8 1 4. [8 marks] In this question, we consider once again the Dominating Set problem from Tutorial 3. Recall that this problem is de˝ned as follows: Given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer k, we want to ˝nd a subset W of V such that |W | ≤ k, and every elements of V − W is joined by an edge to an element of W . Here is a reduction from the Dominating Set problem to the Boolean Satis˝ability problem: (a) For each pair vi, vi′ of vertices of G, and integer j such that 1 ≤ j ≤ k, we add the clause X i,j ∨X i′,j to the instance of SAT. (b) For each vertex vi of G ‹ Assume the neighbours of vi are vi1, vi2, . . . vit. ‹ Let us denote by Yi,j the expression Xi,j ∨ Xi1,j ∨ Xi2,j ∨ Xi3,j ∨ · · · ∨ Xit,j. ‹ We add the clause Yi,1 ∨ Yi,2 ∨ · · · ∨ Yi,k to the instance of SAT. For instance, if v1 has neighbours v5 and v8, and k = 3, then we would add the clause X1,1 ∨ X5,1 ∨ X8,1 ∨ X1,2 ∨ X5,2 ∨ X8,2 ∨ X1,3 ∨ X5,3 ∨ X8,3 to the instance of SAT. a. [4 marks] Suppose the graph G has a dominating set W that contains at most k vertices. Show how to set the values of the variables in the instance of SAT to make every clause evaluate to True. b. [4 marks] Suppose that it is possible to assign the value True or False to each variable in the instance of SAT in a way that makes every clause evaluate to True. Show why this means that the graph G has a dominating set with at most k vertices. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
