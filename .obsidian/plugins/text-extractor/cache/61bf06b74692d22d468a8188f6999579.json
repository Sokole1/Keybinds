(a)(7 points) Find the solution of the given initial value problem in explicit form: d dt y = y2 t , y(1) = 2. Answer. This is §2.2 #12. Write the equation as y−2dy = t−1dt. Integrating, −y−1 = ln t + c. Initial condition gives c = −1/2. Thus y(t) = 2 1 − 2 ln t . (b)(3 points) Determine the interval of existence of the solution in (a). Answer. The interval must contain t = 1. The solution makes sense only if t > 0 and ln t ̸= 1/2, i.e., t ̸= √e. Thus the interval is 0 < t < √e April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 3 of 13 2.(10 points) Solve the initial value problem dy dx = − 2x + y2 + 1 y , y(0) = 1. Answer. We have M dx + N dy = 0, M = 2x + y2 + 1, N = y. Since My = 2y and Nx = 0, it is not exact. Try a multiplier µ(x), (M µ)y = 2yµ, (N µ)x = yµx. Thus µ′ = 2µ. We may take µ(x) = e 2x. We get ψx = (2x + y2 + 1)e 2x, ψy = ye 2x. Thus ψ = ∫ (2x + y2 + 1)e 2xdx = e 2x(x + 1 2 y2) + h(y). ψy = e 2xy + h ′(y) = ye 2x, or h′(y) = 0. Hence h(y) =const and the general solution of the DE is given implicitly by the equation e2x(x + 1 2 y2) = c, c is a constant. Using the initial condition y(0) = 1, we get c = 1/2. Hence the solution of the IVP is given implicitly by the equation e 2x(2x + y2) = 1. Alternative: One has yy′ + y2 = −2x − 1. Let u = y2. It becomes u′ + 2u = −4x − 2 and (e2xu)′ = −(4x + 2)e2x. Integrating, e2xy2 = −2xe2x + c. Initial condition gives c = 1. Remark. Explicit formula: y = √e−2x − 2x. April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 4 of 13 3. (a)(6 points) Solve y′′ − 5y′ − 6y = 0, y(0) = 2, y′(0) = −9. Answer. The characteristic equation is r2 − 5r − 6 = 0 with roots r = −1, 6. The general solution is y(t) = c1e−t + c2e 6t. The initial conditions give c1 + c2 = 2, −c1 + 6c2 = −9. Thus c1 = 3, c2 = −1, and y(t) = 3e−t − e 6t. (b)(6 points) Use the method of reduction of order to ﬁnd a second solution y2(t) of the equation t2y′′ + ty′ − 4y = 0, t > 0; y1(t) = t2 which is independent of y1. Answer. Let y2 = t2v. Then y′ 2 = t2v′ + 2tv and y′′ 2 = t2v′′ + 4tv′ + 2v. Thus 0 = t2y′′ 2 + ty′ 2 − 4y2 = (t 4v′′ + 4t 3v′ + 2t 2v) + t3v′ + 2t2v − 4t2v = t 4v′′ + 5t3v′. Let w = v′. We have w′ + 5 t w = 0. Thus dw w = −5 dt t and ln w = −5 ln t + c. We conclude w = At−5 and v = ∫ w = −At−4/4 + B. We may take A = −4 and B = 0 to get v = t−4 and y2(t) = y1(t)v(t) = t2 · t −4 = t−2. Remark. Some tried explicit solutions of the form y(t) = tn. It is the standard way for Euler equations but is not the method required by the problem. April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 5 of 13 (c)(6 points) Find the general solution of y′′ + 4y′ + 4y = t −2e −2t, given that y1(t) = e−2t and y2(t) = te−2t solve y′′ + 4y′ + 4y = 0. Answer. This is §3.6 #7. The solution is only for t > 0. Wronskian W = W [y1, y2] = e −4t. A particular solution is yp(t) = u1(t)y1(t) + u2(t)y2(t) with u1(t) = − ∫ y2g W dt = − ∫ te−2tt−2e−2t e−4t dt = − ∫ 1 t dt = − ln t u2(t) = ∫ y1g W dt = ∫ e−2tt−2e−2t e−4t dt = ∫ t−2dt = −1/t Hence yp(t) = −e −2t ln t − e −2t. The general solution is y(t) = c1e −2t + c2te−2t − e−2t ln t. Alternative solution using reduction of order: Let y = e−2tv. Then y′ = e−2t(−2v + v′), y′′ = e−2t(4v − 4v′ + v′′) and e2t(y′′ + 4y′ + 4y) = v′′ = t −2. Integrating, v′ = −t −1 + c2, v = − ln t + c2t + c1, and y = e−2t(− ln t + c2t + c1). April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 6 of 13 4.(10 points) Suppose the motion of a certain mass-spring system satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation u ′′ + γu ′ + 4u = 0, u(0) = 1, u ′(0) = a, (1) with units m, kg, and s. Here u(t) is the displacement from the equilibrium position, γ > 0 is the damping coeﬃcient, and a is a real parameter. (a) Determine the range of γ so that the solution u(t) is not oscillatory. Answer. The characteristic equation is r2 + γr + 4 = 0, with roots 1 2 (−γ ± √ γ2 − 16). The solution is not oscillatory if γ2 − 16 ≥ 0, i.e., 4 ≤ γ < ∞. (b) Suppose γ = 5. Determine the range of real a so that the solution of (1) returns to the equilibrium point u = 0 at some t > 0. Answer. Here t means ﬁnite time. The characteristic equation is r2 + 5r + 4 = 0, with roots r = −1, −4. The general solution to the homogeneous equation is u(t) = c1e−t + c2e −4t. We have u′(t) = −c1e−t − 4c2e−4t. Invoking the initial conditions, 1 = c1 + c2, a = −c1 − 4c2. Thus c1 = 4+a 3 and c2 = − 1+a 3 . Thus u(t) = 4 + a 3 e−t − 1 + a 3 e−4t. To return to zero, we need u(t) = 0 for some ﬁnite t > 0, i.e., e 3t = 1 + a 4 + a . We need 1 + a 4 + a > 1. If a < −4, we need 1 + a < 4 + a which is always true. If a > −4, we need 1 + a > 4 + a which is never true. Thus a < −4. April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 7 of 13 5. (a)(6 points) Find the Laplace transform Y (s) of the solution of y′′ + y = g(t), g(t) = { 1 if 0 ≤ t < 2 cos(t − 2) if t ≥ 2 y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 2. Do NOT attempt to ﬁnd y(t) ! Answer. L(y′′ + y) = s2Y (s) − s − 2 + Y (s). Since g(t) = 1 − u2(t) + u2(t) cos(t − 2) = 1 + u2(t)f (t − 2) with f (t) = cos t − 1, its Laplace transform is (Lg)(s) = 1 s + e−2s( s s2 + 1 − 1 s ) Thus Y (s) = s + 2 s2 + 1 + 1 s(s2 + 1) + e−2s s (s2 + 1)2 − e−2s 1 s(s2 + 1) . (b)(5 points) Find the inverse Laplace transform of F (s) = s (s + 1)(s + 2)2 . Answer. By partial fraction, F (s) = a s + 1 + b s + 2 + c (s + 2)2 , and one solves a = −1, b = 1, c = 2. Thus (L−1F )(t) = −e −t + e−2t + 2te−2t. April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 8 of 13 (c)(9 points) Find the solution to the initial value problem y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = δ(t − π); y(0) = 1, y′(0) = −2. Here δ(t) represents the Dirac delta function. Answer. Let Ly = Y (s). Then Ly′ = sY − 1 and Ly′′ = s2Y − s + 2. Thus L(y′′ + 2y′ + 2y) = (s2 + 2s + 2)Y (s) − s. On the other hand, L(δ(t − π)) = e−πs. Thus Y (s) = s s2 + 2s + 2 + 1 s2 + 2s + 2 e−πs. s s2 + 2s + 2 = s (s + 1)2 + 1 = s + 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 − 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 L −1 s + 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 = e−t cos t, L −1 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 = e−t sin t Thus y(t) = e −t cos t − e−t sin t + uπ(t)e−(t−π) sin(t − π) = e −t cos t − e−t sin t − uπ(t)e−(t−π) sin t April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 9 of 13 6.(10 points) For the linear system d dt x = Ax, A = [ 3 −4 1 −1 ] , ﬁnd the general solution and the matrix etA. Answer. Setting det(A − rI) = r2 − 2r + 1 = 0, the eigenvalues are 1, 1. For r = 1, the eigenvector equation (A − rI)ξ = 0 reduces to ξ1 − 2ξ2 = 0. We can take ξ = (2, 1)T and the ﬁrst solution is x(1)(t) = ξet = ( 2 1 ) et. The generalized eigenvector satisﬁes (A − I)η = ξ, which reduces to η1 − 2η2 = 1. If η2 = k where k is an arbitrary constant, then η2 = 1 + 2k and η = (1, 0)T + kξ. Taking k = 0, a second solution is x(2)(t) = (tξ + η)et = ( 2t + 1 t ) e t. The general solution is x(t) = c1x(1)(t) + c2x (2)(t) = c1 (2 1 ) e t + c2 ( 2t + 1 t ) e t. A fundamental matrix is Ψ(t) = (2 2t + 1 1 t ) et. Since Ψ(0) = ( 2 1 1 0 ) with Ψ(0)−1 = (0 1 1 −2 ), we have etA = Ψ(t)Ψ(0) −1 = ( 2t + 1 −4t t −2t + 1 ) e t. Alternative way to ﬁnd Φ(t): Solve for c1, c2 so that x(0) = ( 1 0 ). This x(t) is the ﬁrst column of Φ(t). Solve for c1, c2 so that x(0) = (0 1 ) . This x(t) is the second column of Φ(t). April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 10 of 13 7.(10 points) Solve d dt x = Ax − [ et et ] , x(0) = [ 4 −1 ] , A = [ 1 1 4 −2 ] , given that the general solution of d dt x = Ax is xc(t) = c1 [ 1 1 ] e2t + c2 [ 1 −4 ] e−3t. Answer. By the method of undetermined coeﬃcients, we ﬁrst look for a particular solution of the form xp = [ a1 a2 ] et. Substitution into the ODE yields (after canceling the exponential), [ a1 a2 ] = [ 1 1 4 −2 ] [ a1 a2 ] + [ −1 −1 ] . Thus [ a1 a2 ] = [ 0 1 4 −3 ]−1 [ 1 1 ] = [ 1 1 ] . So the general solution is x(t) = c1 [ 1 1 ] e2t + c2 [ 1 −4 ] e−3t + [ 1 1 ] et. The initial condition gives [ 4 −1 ] = c1 [ 1 1 ] + c2 [ 1 −4 ] + [ 1 1 ] Thus c1 = 2, c2 = 1, and x(t) = [ 2 2 ] e2t + [ 1 −4 ] e −3t + [ 1 1 ] et. Answer 2 by diagonalization. AT = T D where T = ( 1 1 1 −4 ) , T −1 = 1 5 ( 4 1 1 −1 ) , D = T = ( 2 0 0 −3 ) . Let y = T −1x. We have y′ = Dy + T −1g = Dy + ( −et 0 ) , i.e., y′ 1 = 2y1 − e t, y′ 2 = 3y2 Thus y1 = et + c1e2t and y2 = c2e−3t. And x = T y is the solution above. Answer 3 by variation of parameters (Duhamel’s formula). From the general solution, Ψ(t) = (x(1)|x(2)) = (e2t e−3t e2t −4e−3t ) . Thus Ψ −1g = 1 −5e−t ( −4e−3t −e−3t −e2t e2t ) ( −et −et ) = ( −e−t 0 ) . u = ∫ Ψ −1g = ( e−t + c1 c2 ) , and x(t) = Ψ(t)u(t) = (et et ) + Ψ(t) (c1 c2 ) is the solution above. April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 11 of 13 8. Consider the nonlinear system dx dt = 1 − y, dy dt = x 2 − y2. (2) (a)(4 points) Find the critical points for the system (2). Answer. The critical points are solutions of the equations 1 − y = 0 and (x − y)(x + y) = 0. The ﬁrst equation requires that y = 1. Based on the second equation, x = ±1. Hence the critical points are (−1, 1) and (1, 1). (b)(2 points) Find the Jacobian (partial derivative) matrix for the system (2). Answer. Deﬁning F (x, y) = 1 − y and G(x, y) = x2 − y2, we have J(x, y) = [ Fx(x, y) Fy(x, y) Gx(x, y) Gy(x, y) ] = [ 0 −1 2x −2y ] . April 2010 Math 215 Section 201 Final Exam Page 12 of 13 (c)(6 points) Use the linear systems near each critical point to classify them, specifying both the type of critical point and whether it is (asymptotically) stable or unstable. Answer. At the critical point (−1, 1), the coeﬃcients matrix of the linearized system is [ 0 −1 −2 −2 ] with characteristic equation r2 + 2r − 2 = 0 and eigenvalues −1 − √3 and −1 + √3. The eigenvalues are real, with opposite sign. Hence the critical point is a saddle, which is unstable. At the equilibrium point (1, 1), the coeﬃcients of the linearized system is [ 0 −1 2 −2 ] with characteristic equation r2 + 2r + 2 = 0 and complex conjugate eigenvalues −1 ± i. The critical point is a stable spiral, which is asymptotically stable.
