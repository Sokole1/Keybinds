That is, we already have an independent pair of functions 1 = 1 (x) and y2 = y2(x) for which ) = ey + e is a general solution to the homogeneous equation. For our example, 2y -y 42y =307, the corresponding homogeneous equation is the Euler equation Xy =2y +2y =0 You can easily verify that this homogeneous equation is satisfied if y is either w=x o yp=2 . Clearly, the set {x, x?) is linearly independent, and, so, the general solution o the corresponding homogeneous homogeneous equation is o= ex + o .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
