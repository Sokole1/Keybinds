It has spring constant k, mass m, and there is a friction force —ca’ that acts on it. Then z(t) is modelled by the ODE ma\" + ez’ + kz = 0. (a) Suppose the friction is negligible (c ~ 0) and the spring constant is k = 1. It is known that the spring is oscillating with frequency of 0.5 hertz (i.e. 0.5 full periods per second).
