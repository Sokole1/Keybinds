And this is the slope a solution y(z) would have at z if its value was y. In other words, f(z,y) is the slope of a solution whose graph runs through the point (z,y). At a point (z,y), we plot a short line with the slope f(z,y). For example, if f(z,y) = zy, then at point (2,1.5) we draw a short line of slope zy = 2 x 1.5 = 3. So, if y(z) is a solution and y(2) = 1.5, then the equation mandates that ' (2) = 3. See Figure 1.2. -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 -1 -1 2 2 B33 2 -1 0 1 2 3° Figure 1.2.
