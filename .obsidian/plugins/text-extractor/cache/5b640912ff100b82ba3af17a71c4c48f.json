October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 2 of 5 1. Consider the following initial value problem: { y′ + xy = x3, y(0) = 1. (1) (a)(4 points) Use the integrating factor method to express the solution to problem (1) in terms of an indeﬁnite integral with a constant of integration. Solution: (b)(4 points) Evaluate the integral and the constant of integration to ﬁnd an explicit solution to problem (1). Solution: (c)(2 points) What is the maximum interval of existence for the solution of part (a)? Solution: October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 3 of 5 2. (a)(5 points) Solve the diﬀerential equation implicitly: y′ = 4 x(2 − y2) , with y(1) = 1. (2) Solution: (b)(5 points) Use Euler’s method with constant step size h = 1 2 to approximate the solution at y = 2. Solution: October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 4 of 5 3. Let k be a real constant, consider the following diﬀerential equation: (2x2 + y) + (x2y + kx)y′ = 0, for x > 0. (3) (a)(4 points) Find the value of k such that r(x) = 1 x2 is an integrating factor for the equation (3). Solution: (b)(6 points) When k takes the value found in the previous part, ﬁnd the solution to the problem (3) with the initial value condition y(1) = 2. (You can keep the implicit form of the solution) Solution: October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 5 of 5 4. (a)(7 points) Consider the following autonomous diﬀerential equation: y′ = y(y + 1)2(y − 2). (4) Draw the phase diagram of the problem (4), and classify the critical points of the problem (4) stable or unstable. Solution: (b)(3 points) It’s known that y1(x) = 2x and y2(x) = 2x + 2e−x2 are two solutions to the diﬀerential equation y′ = 2 + 4x2 − 2xy. Let g(x) be the solution to the initial value problem: { y′ = 2 + 4x2 − 2xy, y(0) = 1. (5) Explain why y1(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ y2(x) for all x > 0. Find the limit lim x→∞ g(x) x and explain why.
