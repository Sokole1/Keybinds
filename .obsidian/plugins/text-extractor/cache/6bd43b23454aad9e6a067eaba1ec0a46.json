Show that the following functions are convex: 1. f(w) = aw® — Bw + v with w € R,a > 0,3 € R, € R (1D quadratic). 2. f(w) = —log(aw) with a > 0 and w > 0 (“negative logarithm”) 3. f(w) = || Xw -y + 3|wl with w € R? X > 0 (Ll-regularized robust regression). 4. f(w) = Y, log(1 + exp(—yiwT ;) with w € R? (logistic regression). 5. f(w) = Yor, [max{0, [Tz, — yi[} — €] + 3|w||3 with w € R%, ¢ > 0,A > 0 (support vector regression).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
