For a random walk in d dimensions taking i.i.d. steps, we have seen that the expected number of visits to the origin is given by m vzi‘r\" / ot 1 :i,u?»dﬂ‘;’ ® where ¢ (F) is the characteristic function of a single step. For d = 3, we have discussed the simple random walk on the cubic lattice Z* where the six allowed steps are of the form (+1,0,0), (0,£1,0), (0,0,%+1). A random walk on the face-centred cubic lattice takes steps of the form (£1,£1,0), (£1,0,£1), (0,1, +1) with equal probabilities ;. (a) Show that #1(k) { (cos ky cos ky + cos k; cos ks + cos ks cos k1) for the walk on the f;u-:ﬂ:-ﬂnu':'xl cubic lattice. The trigonometric identity cos(z +y) + cos(z y) = 2cosz cosy is useful here. (b) Deduce that the integrand in (1) has singularities not only for k = 0 but at eight additional points on the boundary of the Brillouin zone [, 7]* (c) Using a Taylor expansion to second order (neglecting all terms beyond the quadratic), argue that the singularity at & = 0 is integrable. (The other singularities are also integrable, leading to the conclusion that m < oo and hence the walk is transient, but you need not show this.) qe Sk O wrl- % > - s o Ic > D sty whn dorwinde =00 C*ST;)K Mﬁi (\\ di&\\(\\ ik | = B i =5 N 3 = L Kivde, F < ks +65 l ) =0 i l - &1:“ XZ%H;WJ T ey o sk, + ok (ak eskki=3 o 11 i e 1 i, Tehe we rad sk [QS)(.Ll DSIQ(%J(SL(&S(@)(F | b (E(L' it %—t |— \\Sv._ \\g}+ \\ |‘,;L~ Ez] z 2, 1= tho ol Mus o () s et Az i) 0 WACHE \"y ML\\O‘/\\L/ @\\S(J\\MS(Z\\): -l - e LJ oy g ol by | AE m - Silie i Sl eae ﬁra& NS L =T : tach 3 dimengmn L § =~ T PO ey Bt S mand Ore_ ZJ-_—/K (Mv7l/a ,ﬂ(mm?‘af\\)f\\& @ﬂ’] G106 4(31 FEEHET s","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
