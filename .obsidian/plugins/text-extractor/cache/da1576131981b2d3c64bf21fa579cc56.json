Suppose that the alcohol is eliminated from the blood stream of a human at a rate k > 0 (measured in inverse seconds) proportional to the amount of the alcohol present. We also assume that the alcohol enters the human’s blood stream at a constant continuous rate R (measured in grammes per second). a) Write the first order differential equation describing the amount of alcohol Q (in grammes) in the blood stream (2 points). b) If Q(0) = Qo, find the solution to the initial value problem (2 points). ¢) What limit value reaches the solution when ¢ — oo (1 point)?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
