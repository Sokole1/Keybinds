(6 points) Determine whether the following statements are true or false. There is no need to justify your answer; just write T/F at a visible place. (a) Suppose f(z) is a smooth function with several continuous derivatives. If the second- order accurate formula Aﬂ)%ﬂ) is used to approximate f’(z) in the IEEE 754 double precision floating point system, then the absolute error |ﬁﬂ)%ﬂl - f’(z)‘ can be made arbitrarily small by setting h arbitrarily small. (b) The problem of evaluating f(z) = \\/z at = 2 (i.e., evaluating /2 = 1.414...) is well conditioned. (c) For a floating point system defined by (8,t,L,U), the rounding unit n = %Hl't (when rounding is used) is equal to the smallest positive number. (d) The largest positive number in the IEEE 754 double precision floating point system is approximately 10308, If z = 102%°, then even though v/z2 = z in exact arithmetic, on this floating point system the result of computing v/z2 is not equal or approximately equal (with a relative error up to rounding unit) to z. (e) Suppose a function f(z) has a zero z* that satisfies f(z*) = 0. If the derivative satisfies f'(z*) = 0 then bisection cannot possibly be applied for computing z*. (f) Suppose a function f(z) is continuous, has a continuous derivative, and has a zero z* that satisfies f(z*) = 0 in a given interval, [a,b]. If in that interval f(z) > 0 for all z # z*, then Newton’s method cannot possibly converge to z* for an initial guess in [a, b].","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
