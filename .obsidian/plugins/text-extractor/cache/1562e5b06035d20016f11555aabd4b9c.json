Consider the problem u = kuy, + Q(x,t), O0<x<L, t>0 u@©,)=0, wl,t)=0, t>0 u(x,0) = f(x), O0<x<L (7.6.1) The homogeneous version of this problem is given by U, =kUy, O<x<L, t>0, v(0,t) =0, u(L,t)=0. (7.62) We know that a separation of variables leads to the eigenvalue problem \" +2p=0, ¢0)=0, ¢L)=0. The eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given by . nmx nm\\2 ¢n(x) = sin A An = (T) , n=1,2,3,.... We can use these eigenfunctions to obtain a solution of the nonhomogeneous problem (7.6.1). We begin by assuming the solution is given by the eigenfunction expansion UG, 1) = ) an(Pn(x). (163) n=1 In general, we assume that v(x, t) and ¢,(x) satisfy the same boundary conditions and that v(x, t) and v,(x, t) are continuous functions.Note that the difference between this eigenfunction expansion and that in Section 4.3 is that the expansion coefficients are functions of time. In order to carry out the full process, we will also need to expand the initial profile, f(x), and the source term, Q(x, t), in the basis of eigenfunctions. Thus, we assume the forms","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
