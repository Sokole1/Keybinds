A second-order chemical reaction involves the interaction of one molecule of a substance P with one molecule of a substance @ to produce one molecule of a new substance X; this is denoted by P+ Q — X. Suppose that p and ¢, where p # ¢, are the initial concentrations of P and Q, respectively, and let z(¢) be the concentration of X at time t. Then p — z(t) and ¢ — z(t) are the concentrations of P and @ at time ¢, and the rate at which the reaction occurs is given by the equation dx — =a(p—x)(q¢—x), o = p-a)g—a) where « is a positive constant. (a) if 2(0) = 0, determine the limiting value of z(t) as t — oo without solving the differential equation. Then solve the initial value problem and find z(t) for any ¢. (b) If the substances P and (Q are the same, then p = ¢ and the equation is replaced by dx 9 @ s a(p—=)*. If 2(0) = 0, determine the limiting value of x(t) as t — oo without solving the differential equation. Then solve the initial value problem and determine z(t) for any ¢.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
