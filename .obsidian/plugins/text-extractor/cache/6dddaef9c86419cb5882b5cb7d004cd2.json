Consider the curve given by ⃗r (t) = (2 cos t, 2 sin t, t 2) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Compute ∫ C √z ds. 2. Let C be the line segment from (0, 3) to (2, 3). Compute ∫ C xe ydx + x2ydy. 3. Evaluate the line integrals Ij = ∫ Cj (x + 2y) dx + x2 dy, j = 1, 2, where C1 is the line segment from (0, 0) to (4, 0), and C2 consists of line segments from (0, 0) to (2, 1) and from (2, 1) to (4, 0). Is I1 equal to I2? 4. Evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C z2dx + x2dy + y2dz, where C is the line segment from (1, 0, 0) to (−2, 1, 2). 5. Evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r, where ⃗F = x̂ııı + y ̂ + yz ̂k and C is given by the vector function ⃗r(t) = cos t̂ııı + sin t̂ + t ̂k , 0 ≤ t ≤ π. 6. Determine if ⃗F = ⟨x3, −y4⟩ is conservative or not. If conservative, ﬁnd a potential. 7. Determine if ⃗F = ⟨xe y, ye x⟩ is conservative or not. If conservative, ﬁnd a potential. 8. Suppose that a particle of mass M is ﬁxed at the origin (0, 0, 0) while a particle of mass m moves from (a, 0, 0) to (0, b, 0) along the ellipse (x/a) 2 + (y/b) 2 = 1 on the xy-plane under the gravitational force ⃗F(x, y, z) = − GM m |⟨x, y, z⟩|3 ⟨x, y, z⟩, where G is a constant. Compute the work done by the force on the particle of mass m. Page 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
