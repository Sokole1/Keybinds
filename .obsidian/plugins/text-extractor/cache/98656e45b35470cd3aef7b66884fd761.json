(a) L =  × 0 0 × × 0 0 × ×   ; U =  × 0 × 0 × × 0 0 ×   . (b) The LU decomposition of T A is given, so we can solve T Ax = T b by LU x = T b. We do this as follows: (i) compute c = T b, which takes O(n 2) operations, (ii) solve Ly = c by forward substitu- tion, in O(n2) operations, and (iii) solve U x = y by backward substitution, which also entails O(n2) operations. So, the overall computational cost is O(n2) operations, as required. 2. (a) We have A(x − y) = b − c, which implies (x − y) = A −1(b − c). Taking norms, we have ∥x − y∥ ≤ ∥A −1∥∥b − c∥ ≤ α · ∥A−1∥ · ∥b∥. (b) From Ax = b we have ∥b∥ ≤ ∥A∥∥x∥ and hence 1 ∥x∥ ≤ ∥A∥ ∥b∥ . This yields, using part (a), ∥x−y∥ ∥x∥ ≤ α∥A∥∥A−1∥ = ακ(A). 3. (a) A semicolon at the end of a Matlab command suppresses output: the command is carried out but nothing is printed on the screen. (b) A semicolon between elements of a matrix separates rows: it marks the end of a row of the matrix. (c) Because zeros are not stored in sparse matrix format, just nonzero values and their associated row and column indexes. (d) Backslash solves the system via the LU decomposition (Gaussian elimination) whereas x = inv(A) ∗ b computes the inverse of A explicitly and then multiplies it by b. (The former is the way to go numerically.) (e) This command computes the solution of the least-squares problem minx ∥b − Ax∥2. 4. (a) ∥Qx∥2 2 = (Qx)T Qx = xT Q T Q | {z } I x = xT x = ∥x∥2 2, and the desired result follows by taking the square root on both sides. (b) for any vector x we have xT (AT A)x = (Ax) T (Ax) = ∥Ax∥2 2 ≥ 0. (c) In part (b) it was shown that AT A is symmetric positive semidef- inite. We now have for any vector x ̸= 0 and γ > 0, xT (A T A + γI)x = xT AT Ax + γxT x > 0. Therefore A T A + γI is symmetric positive deﬁnite, and Cholesky can be used. 5. (a) TRUE (b) FALSE (counterexample: u T F u = −1 < 0) (c) TRUE (d) FALSE (F 2 = F F T = I ̸= F ) (e) TRUE (since F is orthogonal, it is nonsingular)","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
