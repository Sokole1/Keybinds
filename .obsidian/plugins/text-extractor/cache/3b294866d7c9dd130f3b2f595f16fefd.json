The principle we use below to derive it can be directly extended to more general problems. Assume that the first and second derivatives of f exist and are continuous: f € C2[a,b]. Assume also that f’(z) can be evaluated with sufficient ease. Let z, be a current iterate. By Taylor’s expansion on page 6 we can write f(@) = flar) + f (z) (@ — zx) + (€)@ — 2x)?/2, 2.3. Newton’s method and variants 45 where () is some (unknown) point between z and . Now, set z = z*, for which f(z*) = 0. If f were linear, i.e., f = 0, then we could find the root by solving 0 = f(zx) + f(zx)(z* — zx), yielding z* = zy — f(z)/f'(zx). Fora nonlinear function we therefore define the next iterate by the same formula, which gives f(zk) Tk =Tk — F, s k=0,1,2,.... ! f'(zx) This corresponds to neglecting the term f”(£(z*))(z* — z1)?/2 when defining the next iterate; however, if zy, is already close to z*, then (z* — zk)2 is very small, so we would expect 1 to be much closer to z* than xy, is. A geometric interpretation of Newton’s method is that . ; is the z-intercept of the tangent line to f at zy; see Figure 2.3.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
