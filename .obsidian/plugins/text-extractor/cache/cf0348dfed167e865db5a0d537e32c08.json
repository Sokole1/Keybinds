We know that 2 + y? = 1, so as usual, we use the angle from the positive z-axis to the point (z, y) on the zy-plane as the parameter to get = = cost and y = sint for 0 < ¢ < 2m. This choice also determines 2 =a? —y? = cos®t — sin’t, which gives the parametrization ©(t) = (cost,sint,cos? t — sin® ). (b) Note that '(t) = P when t = w/4.
