As such, you are not expected to know the answers to several of the questions in this chapter. Question 5.5 (a) This is the usual Gaussian elimination procedure, but we need to zero out only one element below the main diagonal for each of the ﬁrst n − 1 columns. Therefore, for each column we replace the loop in the standard GE algorithm by a single operation of computing the multiplier. In the algorithm provided below we have an n × n upper Hessenberg matrix H as input, and overwrite the upper triangular part of H by U , and the subdiagonal by the multipliers. Algorithm 1 Gaussian elimination for an upper Hessenberg matrix for k = 1 to n − 1 do hk+1,k = hk+1,k hkk for j = k + 1 to n do hk+1,j = hk+1,j − hk+1,khkj end for end for (b) L is a lower bidiagonal matrix (with diagonal elements equal to 1). For example, for n = 5 we have L =       × 0 0 0 0 × × 0 0 0 0 × × 0 0 0 0 × × 0 0 0 0 × ×  | | | |  . (c) It takes O(n2) ﬂops to form the LU decomposition, O(n) ﬂops to do forward substitution Ly = b (since L is lower bidiagonal), and O(n2) to do backward substitution, U x = y. So, the overall amount of work is O(n2) ﬂops. (d) If row partial pivoting in its simplest form is done, then at each step there is only one candidate to choose as an alternative pivot. The matrix L such that P A = LU will be unit lower triangular, but its elements below the main diagonal may be row-permuted. Thus, there is only one nonzero element li,k, i > k for each column 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, but the nonzero element is not necessarily the one below the main diagonal, i.e., it is no longer true that i = k + 1. On the other hand, the matrix U is simply a dense upper triangular matrix. 1 Question 5.6 Assuming no pivoting, A after one column elimination is just a general densse matrix. Hence processing it requires n2 storage locations and O(n3) ﬂops. On the other hand, B requires only O(n) storage locations and O(n) ﬂops. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
