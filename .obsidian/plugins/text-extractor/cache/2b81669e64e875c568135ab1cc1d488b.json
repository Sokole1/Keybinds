The tires stay in contact with the road and rotate in a predictable pattern. Now suppose a very determined ant is tired after a long day and wants to get home. So he hangs onto the side of the tire and gets a free ride. The path that this ant travels down a straight road is called a cycloid (Figure 10.1.8). A cycloid generated by a circle (or bicycle wheel) of radius a is given by the parametric equations x(t) = a(t —sint), y(©) = a(l - cos 1). To see why this is true, consider the path that the center of the wheel takes. The center moves along the x-axis at a constant height equal to the radius of the wheel. If the radius is a, then the coordinates of the center can be given by the equations x()=at, yt)=a for any value of t. Next, consider the ant, which rotates around the center along a circular path. If the bicycle is moving from left to right then the wheels are rotating in a clockwise direction. A possible parameterization of the circular motion of the ant (relative to the center of the wheel) is given by x(t) = —asint Y(t) = —acost. (The negative sign is needed to reverse the orientation of the curve. If the negative sign were not there, we would have to imagine the wheel rotating counterclockwise.) Adding these equations together gives the equations for the cycloid. X(t) = a(t - sint) Y(®) = a(l - cos t) y x Figure 10.1.8: A wheel traveling along a road without slipping; the point on the edge of the wheel traces out a cycloid. Now suppose that the bicycle wheel doesn't travel along a straight road but instead moves along the inside of a larger wheel, as in Figure 10.1.9. In this graph, the green circle is traveling around the blue circle in a counterclockwise direction. A point on the edge of the green circle traces out the red graph, which is called a hypocycloid. y 7 6 5 X(t) = 3cos t + cos 3t y(t) = 3sint — sin 3t o \\I,’ Lt -5 -6 =7 Figure 10.1.9: Graph of the hypocycloid described by the parametric equations shown.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
