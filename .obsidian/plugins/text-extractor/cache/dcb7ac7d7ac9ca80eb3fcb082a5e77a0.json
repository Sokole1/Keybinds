(8 points) For each of the following methods, how many trainable parameters does the model have? In other words, how many values need to be stored after training in order to make predictions? Your answers may involve n, d, and perhaps additional quantities defined in the question. Ex- press your answer in big-O notation. As an example, (linear) least squares has O(d) parameters. (a) naive Bayes with binary features, k classes, and Laplace smoothing strength j. (b) linear SVM with regularization strength A. (c) linear regression with d = 1 using a polynomial basis of degree p.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
