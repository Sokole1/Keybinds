Here we’ll explore a way to solve WSP by “reducing” it to BFS. For this, we’ll assume that each weight is a positive integer. 1. How can we transform (i.e., “reduce”) our WSP example instance into an unweighted bfs input, while preserving distances? Fill in the corresponding bfs instance on the right.
