Determine whether x = 0 or x = 1 is an ordinary point of the diﬀeren- tial equation. 2. Find a recurrence formula for the power series solution around x = 0 for the diﬀerential equation (1). Question 2 We consider the following non-homogeneous diﬀerential equation ( x2 + 4) y′′ + xy = x + 2 (2) 1. Find a recurrence formula for the power series solution around x = 0 for (2). 2. Use the power series method to ﬁnd the general solution near x = 0 of (2) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
