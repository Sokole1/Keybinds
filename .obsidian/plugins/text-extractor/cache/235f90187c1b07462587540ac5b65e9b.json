(A non-sparse version of this matrix can be obtained in MATLAB with the instruction A = diag(a*ones(n,1),0) + diag(b*ones(n-1,1),1) + diag(b*ones(n-1,1),-1) Type help spdiags for the scoop on the sparse version.) (a) Find ||A||oo. (b) Show that if A is strictly diagonally dominant then it is symmetric positive definite. (c) Suppose a > 0 and b > 0 are such that A is symmetric positive definite. Find the condition number £3(A). (Assuming that n is large, an approximate value would suffice. You may also assume that a # 2b.)","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
