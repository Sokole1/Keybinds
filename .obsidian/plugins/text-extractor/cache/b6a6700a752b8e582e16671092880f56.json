Show that p ∤ n, where n is a positive integer, if and only if ϕ(np) = (p − 1)ϕ(n). (3pts) 2. Show that if m and n are positive integers and (m, n) = p, where p is prime, then ϕ(mn) = pϕ(m)ϕ(n)/(p − 1). (3pts) 3. Find all positive integers n such that a) σ(n) = 24 and b) τ (n) = 14. (4 pts) 4. Show that the equation σ(n) = k has at most a ﬁnite number of solutions when k is a positive integer. (2pts) 5. Write down a formula for the seventh and eighth even perfect numbers.You may use the result that the ﬁrst six Mersenne primes correspond to the primes p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, and 219 − 1 is prime, 223 − 1 and 229 − 1 are composite, but 231 − 1 is prime. (4pts) 6. Determine whether the Mersenne numbers M17 is a prime. You are given that M17 = 131071 and (363)2 > 131071, and the primes less than 363 are 103, 137, 239 and 307. Use the Lucas-Lehmer test to show that M7 is a prime. You are given that the integer r5 = 111 modulo 127 is 111. You may use a calculator but should show your work.
