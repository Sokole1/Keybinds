If conservative, find a potential. (b) Compute the line integral I = [, F - dF, where C is a line segment from (1,—1) to (2,1). Solution. (a) Let F; = 2ze¥ and F, = 2y —a?e V. Note 0,F, = 0 —2ze ¥ and 8,F; = —2ze V. Since 9, F; = 8,F; holds on the entire simply-connected set R?, we know there exists a potential function. We now look for a potential f(z,y) so that F= Vf. From the equation 8 f = Fy, we have flz,y) = /Zze“’dz = 2%V + h(y). Using the second equation dyf = F Oof =2y —a%e ¥ = —ze ™V + K (y) Thus k'(y) = 2y and h(y) = y* + ¢. We can choose ¢ = 0 and flay) =a*e ¥ +y? is a potential for the vector field.
