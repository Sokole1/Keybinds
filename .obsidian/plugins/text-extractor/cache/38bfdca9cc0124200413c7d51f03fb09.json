Compute the following expressions and write your answer in terms of ⃗r and ρ whenever possible. (a) ∇ρ (b) ∇ × ⃗r (c) ∇(ρ−1) (d) ∇ log ρ 2. Let ⃗F = ⟨2xe−y, 2y − x2e −y⟩. (a) Determine if ⃗F is conservative or not. If conservative, ﬁnd a potential. (b) Compute the line integral I = ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r , where C is a line segment from (1, −1) to (2, 1). 3. Let ⃗F = ⟨e y, xe y + sin z, y cos z⟩. Find the work done by the force on an object that moves from (0, 0, 0) to (1, −1, 3). 4. For a constant A, suppose that the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y) = ⟨xye y, Ax 2e y(1 + y)⟩ has the path-independence property; the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r depends only on the endpoints of C. Determine the constant A. 5. Compute the line integral ∫ C yzdx + xzdy + xydz, where C is the curve that consists of 3 line segments L1 from (0, 0, 0) to (2, 1, 2) and L 2 from (2, 1, 2) to (9, 1, −1), and L3 from (9, 1, −1) to (0, 0, 0). 6. Let ⃗F(x, y, z) = ⟨6x5y2z3, 2x6yz3, 3x6y2z2 + y⟩. (a) Compute curl ⃗F = ∇ × ⃗F. What can you say about ⃗F from the computation? (b) Let C be the line segment from (0, 1, 2) to (1, 3, 2). Compute the line integral∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r. (Hint: you may avoid a possibly tedious direct calculation.) Page 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
