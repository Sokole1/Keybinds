In parts (b,c), print and submityour code and plots. a) Let Y denote the number of earthquakes in a period of 100 decades. What is the distributionof Y ? Answer: Number of decades between two serious earthquakes is 𝑋 ∼ Exp ( 𝜆 = 1 ) . So about 1 earthquake every decade. Then over 100 decades we would expect 100 earthquakes. So 𝜆 = 1 0 0 for a poisson distribution. 𝑌 ∼ Poisson ( 1 0 0 ) b) Using Python, generate independent random variables 𝑋 1 , … , 𝑋 1 0 0 0 0 each of which gives the total number of earthquakes that occur in a simulation of a period of 100 decades. Present theresults in a histogram which shows the number of 100 decade periods (among the 10000) whichproduced any given total number of earthquakes. import numpy as np import matplotlib . pyplot as plt lammy = 100 repeats = 10000 samples = np . random . poisson ( lammy , repeats ) plt . hist ( samples ) plt . title ( f ' 6 b) number of earthquakes ' ) plt . xlabel ( ' # of Earthquakes ' ) plt . ylabel ( ' Frequency ' ) plt . show ( ) 3 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 5 77253938 c) Using the same simulation as in (b), for 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 1 0 0 0 0 , let 𝑀 ( 𝑖 ) denote the number of 𝑗 ∈ { 1 , … , 𝑖 } such that 𝑋 𝑗 = 1 0 0 .
