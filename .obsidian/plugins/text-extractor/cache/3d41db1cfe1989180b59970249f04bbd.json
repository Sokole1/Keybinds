Regions @ Availability Zones Spotlight on the us-west-1 Region. Northern California, Oregon, and GovCloud (US-West) are separate Regions. The Northern California Region is called us-west-1, and this Region contains three AZs (1a, 1b, and 1c). Then, within each AZ there are three data centers. An Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close enough to have low latency (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones. However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.
