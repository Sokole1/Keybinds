Recall that this problem is defined by: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with vertices V and edges E, an integer (positive, zero, or negative) weight h, for each v € V, and an integer (positive, zero, or negative) weight Jy,, for each edge {u,v} € E, find an assignment of +1 or —1 to the variables z, for each v € V' that minimizes the objective function: (Sha) [ £ dum veV (u)eE We will consider a reduction from the Vertez Cover problem, defined as follows: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with vertices V and edges E, and an integer k, find a vertex cover of G: a subset V' of V with k elements such that every edge in E has at least one endpoint in V. Given the graph G, we construct an instance I of ISGM as follows: e Bvery vertex u of G will be a vertex uy of I with weight 1. e For each edge {u,v} of G, we add the following subgraph to I: G Jua=-2 @ Ju,,z = —2 Ja3 =2 @ T30, =2 @ This is essentially the graph used for an OR gate in the assignment, except that we have doubled all of the weights and added an “output” node (the one on the right on the top row). Recall that the values assigned to the vertices of the triangle will contribute a value of —6 if that triangle behaves like a proper OR gate, and of at least +2 if it does not (this is twice the corresponding values from assignment 2 since we doubled all of the edge weights). page 7 out of 2?7 a. [5 marks| Based on the ISGM solution, how/when can you conclude that there is a vertex cover of V' with at most k vertices? Briefly justify your answer. (Once again, your answers should be fairly short).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
