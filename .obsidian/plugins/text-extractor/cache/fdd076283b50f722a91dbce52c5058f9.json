The mill’s two products come off the rolling line at different rates: Bands 200 tons/h Coils 140 tons/h. They also produce different profits: Bands $25/ton Coils $30/ton. Based on currently booked orders, the following upper bounds are placed on the amount of each product to produce: Bands 6,000 tons Coils 4,000 tons. 8 1. INTRODUCTION Given that there are 40 h of production time available this week, the prob- lem is to decide how many tons of bands and how many tons of coils should be produced to yield the greatest profit. Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem. Can you solve this problem by inspec- tion?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
