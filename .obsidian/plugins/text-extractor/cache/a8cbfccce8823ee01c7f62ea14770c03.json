(a) Suppose a parametrized curve ⃗r(t) in R2 is deﬁned on 0 ≤ t < ∞ and has velocity ⃗v = (t cos t, t sin t). Compute the normal vector ˆN(t). Answer: (b) Suppose a parametrized curve ⃗r(t) in R2 has constant speed |⃗v|(t) = 3 and moves along a circle of radius 2. Compute the norm of the acceler- ation |⃗a|. Answer: Page 3 of 7 2. 6 marks Please place your answers in the boxes provided. (a) Consider the conservative vector ﬁeld on R 3 given by ⃗F = (x, y, z). A potential is e.g. ϕ = (1/2)(x2 + y2 + z2). Compute ∫ C ⃗F · dr where C is the curve given by ⃗r(t) = (sin t cos 2 t, t, cos t) from t = 0 to t = 2π. Answer: (b) Let ϕ be a function on R 3 such that ϕ(0, 0, 0) = 3, ∇ϕ(0, 0, 0) = (1, 2, 3). Let ⃗r(t) be a parametrized curve in R3 such that ⃗r(0) = (0, 0, 0), d dt⃗r(0) = (−1, 1, 1). Compute d dt ϕ(⃗r(t)) at t = 0. Answer: Page 4 of 7 3. 10 marks Let ⃗r(t) = (t 2, 2t, t 3 3 ) , 0 ≤ t < ∞. (a) Compute the arclength function s(t) starting from t = 0. (b) Compute the curvature κ(t). Page 5 of 7 This blank page is for your solution to Question 3 if you need more space. Page 6 of 7 4. 10 marks Let ⃗F = ( x (x2 + y2)1/2 , y (x2 + y2)1/2 ) be the vector ﬁeld deﬁned on the domain R 2\\{(0, 0)}. (a) Compute ∫ C ⃗F·dr, where C is the unit circle traveling counter-clockwise. (b) Is ⃗F conservative? If ⃗F is conservative, ﬁnd a potential. If ⃗F is not conservative, explain why not.
