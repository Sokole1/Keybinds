Each such path visits nodes at successively deeper levels of tree, following either tree or dashed edges that go deeper from one level to the next in the tree. Formally, low,(v) = 1 if v if a leaf, and otherwise lows(v) =1+ Z low(z). z | (v,z) â‚¬ E, ds[z] = ds[v] +1 4 Example: low;(6) = 8, since in the BFS tree rooted at 1, the nodes 6, 3, 4, and 5 can be reached by one shortest path from 6, while both nodes 7 and 8 can be reached via two shortest paths from 6. (Remember that dashed edges that go deeper are allowed on these paths.) (a) What is lowy(2)? O1 O 2 O3 O 4 (b) What is low;(4)? O1 O 2 O3 O 4","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
