Circuit vs Packet Switching Suppose that there is a network between locations A and B that can carry 320 kilobits of information per second (kbps). Further suppose that there can be a number (N) of separate data connections between these locations, each of which sends data with a maximum rate of 40 kbps and an average rate of 4 kbps. A number of data connections is considered viable if the network works properly and satisfies all of its guarantees with that number of connections. Answer each of the following questions assuming that the network uses circuit switching. What is the maximum viable value of N? integer o What happens when the number of data connections exceeds the maximum viable number of connections? e Answer each of the following questions assuming that the network uses packet switching.
