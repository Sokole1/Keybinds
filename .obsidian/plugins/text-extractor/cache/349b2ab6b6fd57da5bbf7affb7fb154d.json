(4 marks) Write an algorithm that uses the SATISFIABLE procedure to determine a truth assignment for instance ¢ of SAT, given that ¢ does have such a truth assignment. Your algorithm may make multiple calls to the SATISFIABLE procedure, and should run in polynomial time not counting the time for calls to the SATISFIABLE procedure. Your algorithm can also call the SIMPLFY procedure, which does run in polynomial time. You do not need to explain why your algorithm is correct, or explain its runtime.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
