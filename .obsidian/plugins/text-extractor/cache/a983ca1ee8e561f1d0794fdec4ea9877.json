Assume that all edge weights are nonnegative and distinct. The weight of a spanning tree T' of G is the sum of the edge weights of the tree; we denote it by wt(7'). Since all edge weights are distinct, G has a unique minimum spanning tree. Let Ty = (V, Exin) be this tree. A second best spanning tree for G is a spanning tree T, that is not equal to Ty, and such that for all spanning trees 7\" of G other than Tipin, wt(Tsp) < wt(T\"). Q8.1 1 Point Here's an algorithm that attempts to find a second best spanning tree, given G and Tryy, find the edge ¢’ € E — E,y;, of smallest weight > ¢ is not in the minimum spanning tree Tiyin let e be the max-weight edge of Emiy in the cycle of the graph (V, Emin U {e'}) (that is, in the cycle that would be created if ¢’ were added to Tiin) return (V, By, — {e} U{e'}) Is this algorithm correct (on all inputs G)?
