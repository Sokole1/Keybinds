To understand the magnitude of this fluctuation: i. Let N; = Lif the j** simulation has exactly 100 earthquakes in 100 decades, and otherwise set Nj = 0. Then M(i) = Â¥j_, N;. Use the central limit theorem to conclude that, for large 4, the distribution of M (i) is approximately that of pi + 0v/iZ for appropriate values of 1 and o (determine these values), where Z has a standard normal distribution. ii. Explain why the observed deviation in the plot, between 10~4M(10%) and the limiting value 0.040, is reasonable.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
