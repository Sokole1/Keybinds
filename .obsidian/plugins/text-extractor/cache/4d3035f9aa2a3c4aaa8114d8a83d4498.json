It has spring constant k, mass m, and there is a friction force −cx′ that acts on it. Then x(t) is modelled by the ODE mx′′ + cx ′ + kx = 0. (a) Suppose the friction is negligible (c ≈ 0) and the spring constant is k = 1. It is known that the spring is oscillating with frequency of 0.5 hertz (i.e. 0.5 full periods per second). Determine the mass m of the spring. (b) More careful measurements show that the friction is non zero. In fact the maximum value of x(t) decreases slowly with each pe- riod. Every t = 20 seconds this maximum value is decreased by half as illustrated on the right. Estimate c.
