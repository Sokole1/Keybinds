Each newsletter is devoted to a specific topic: coupons, coffee trivia, and new products. Subscribers will now receive updates immediately for only the specific topics to which they have subscribed. It is possible for subscribers to subscribe to a single topic or to multiple topics. For example, the first customer subscribes to only the coupons topic, and the second subscriber subscribes to only the coffee trivia topic. The third customer subscribes to both the coffee trivia and new products topics. Jox i e b e e i e","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
