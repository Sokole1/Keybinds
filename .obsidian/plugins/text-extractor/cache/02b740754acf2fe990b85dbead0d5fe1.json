None of the following are allowed: documents, cheat sheets or electronic devices of any kind (including calcu- lators, cell phones, etc. ) A formula sheet is provided. Page 1 of 14 1. Consider the following inhomogeneous initial boundary value problem for the heat equation ut = uxx + et sin(7x 2 ) + 1 t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ π, BC: u(0, t) = t, and ux(π, t) = 0 IC: u(x, 0) = 0 Solve this problem by using an expansion in terms of the appropriate eigen- functions, which correspond to the homogeneous form of the stated boundary conditions. (Note: Only show cases that give non-trivial solutions when solving the eigenvalue problems.)

Consider the following initial boundary value problem for the wave equation utt = uxx t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, BC: u(0, t) = 0, and u(2, t) = 0, IC: u(x, 0) = f (x) = { x if 0 ≤ x < 1 0 if 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 , ut(x, 0) = 0 (a) Solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. (Note: Only show cases that give non-trivial solutions when solving the eigenvalue prob- lems.) [30 marks] (b) Sketch the periodic extension that you would assume for the function f (x) on the interval [−6, 6]. [4 marks] (c) Find the Fourier solution you found in (a) for time t = 4. What does the solution converge to at t = 4 and x = 1?
