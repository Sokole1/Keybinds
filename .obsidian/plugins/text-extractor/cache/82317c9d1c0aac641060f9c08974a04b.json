There is no need to justify your answer; just write T/F at a visible place. (a) The result of the computation |x = 1/0 - 1/0|in MATLAB is x=0. (b) Denote by ¢, the smallest positive number on the IEEE 754 double precision floating point system. Then the floating point representation of 1+ ¢, is 1, that is, i(1+¢m) = 1. (c) If a continuous function with a continuous derivative has two distinct fixed points in an interval and a fixed-point iteration is applied, then if the iterative scheme converges to one of the fixed points, it does not necessarily converge to the fixed point that is closer to the initial guess. (d) If the secant method is applied to compute the zero of the function f(z) = =2, which is z* =0, it will always fail to converge regardless of the initial guesses, because f'(z*) = 0. You may use the space below to write notes, state your assumptions, or make a comment, but only your T/F answers will be marked.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
