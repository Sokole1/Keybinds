None of the following are allowed: documents, cheat sheets or electronic devices of any kind (including calcu- lators, cell phones, etc. ) A formula sheet is provided. Page 1 of 14 1. Consider the Bessel equation of order 1/2 x2y′′ + xy′ + (x2 − ν2)y = 0, ν = 1 2 (1) (a) Show that x = 0 is a regular singular point. [6 marks] (b) Use the appropriate series expansion about the point x = 0 to determine two linearly independent solutions to equation (1) . You only need to determine the ﬁrst three non-zero terms in each case. [44 marks] (c) Find the radius of convergence of the series solutions you found in (b).

Consider the second order diﬀerential equation Ly = (1 + x2)y′′ + y = 0, (2) (a) Use the appropriate series expansion about the point x = 0 to determine two linearly independent solutions to equation (2) . You only need to determine the ﬁrst three non-zero terms in each case. [34 marks] (b) Use the ratio test to ﬁnd the radius of convergence of the series solu- tions you found in (a). What could you have said about the minimal radius of convergence without solving the ODE?
