For any pair of nodes z and v, let ¢(z,v) be the total number of shortest paths from z to v. Example: The following graph has one shortest path from 1 to 6. Also there are three shortest paths from 1 to 8. Two of these, namely path 1,2,3,8, and path 1,6,3,8, go through node 3, while one, namely path 1,6,5,8 goes through node 5. 1. (2 points) Draw a breadth first search tree rooted at 1 for the graph above. Include all dashed edges as well as tree edges. 2. (2 points) How many shortest paths are there from node 1 to node 7? That is, what is the value of ¢(1,7)? Give a list of the paths. 3. (4 points) Here is an inductive definition for ¢(z,v): If z = v then there is exactly one shortest path from z to z, so ¢(z, ) is 1. Otherwise, e \\ DY","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
