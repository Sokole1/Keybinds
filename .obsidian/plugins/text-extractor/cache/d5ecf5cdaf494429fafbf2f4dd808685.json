The written part counts for 16 points 1. Solve x′′ = δ(t − 1), x(0) = 1, x′(0) = 0. Sketch the graph of the resulting function. 2. Solve x ′′ + x = δ(t − π) − δ(t − 2π), x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 1. Sketch the graph of the resulting function. 3. Find a ﬁrst order system corresponding to the scalar equation and ﬁnd its general solution. (a) y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = 0. (b) t2y′′ − 4ty′ + 4y = 0, t > 0. (It general solution is of the form y(t) = c1t + c2t4.) 4. Find the general solution to the system x′ = Ax, where A is as speciﬁed below. Make sure to write the solution in purely real form. (a) A = ( 1 0 −4 3 ) . (b) A = ( 1 −5 1 −3 ) . (c) A =   1 0 0 −2 1 2 −2 −2 1   (d) A = ( −5 −3 3 1 ) (You can skip part (d) as it is from §3.7.) 5. A 3 × 3 real matrix has three eigenvalues. One of them is λ1 = −1 and its corresponding eigenvector is v1 =   0 1 0   . Another is λ2 = 1 + i and its corresponding eigenvector is v2 =   1 2 i   . (a) What is the third eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector? (b) Find the general solution to x′ = Ax. (c) Find the solution to x′ = Ax subject to initial condition x (0) =   1 0 0   .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
