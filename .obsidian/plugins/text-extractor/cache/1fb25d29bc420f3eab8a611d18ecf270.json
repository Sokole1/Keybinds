Applying Amdahl's Law Assume that a program spends its time only in ALU operations, Memory operations, and Control Flow operations. You are told that an application spends 84% of its time in the ALU, 5% of its time in the memory system, and 11% of its time in control flow instructions. This program originally takes takes 180 seconds to complete. In how many seconds will this program complete if we make the memory system 2.5 times faster and the control flow instructions 1.5 times faster?
