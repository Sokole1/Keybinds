Consider the following inhomogeneous initial boundary value problem for the heat equa- tion ut = uxx + et sin( 7x 2 ) + 1 t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ π, BC: u(0, t) = t, and ux(π, t) = 0 IC: u(x, 0) = 0 Solve this problem by using an expansion in terms of the appropriate eigenfunctions, which correspond to the homogeneous form of the stated boundary conditions. (Note: Only show cases that give non-trivial solutions when solving the eigenvalue problems.) [total 60 marks] 2 Question 1 (continued): 3 Question 1 (continued): 4 2. (a) Apply the method of separation of variables to determine the solution to the one dimensional heat equation subject to the following periodic boundary conditions and initial condition: ∂u ∂t = ∂2u ∂x2 for t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, BC: u(0, t) = u(2, t), and ∂u(0, t) ∂x = ∂u(2, t) ∂x IC: u(x, 0) = f (x) = { 1 − x if 0 ≤ x < 1 0 if 1 ≤ x < 2 [30 marks] (b) Sketch the periodic extension of the function f (x) on the interval [−4, 4]. [4 marks] (c) Use the Fourier series you found in (a) and by evaluating the value of the periodic extension of f (x) at x = 0, ﬁnd the sum of the inﬁnite series ∞∑ k=0 1 (2k + 1)2 [6 marks] [total 40 marks] 5 Question 2 (continued): 6 Question 2 (continued): 7","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
