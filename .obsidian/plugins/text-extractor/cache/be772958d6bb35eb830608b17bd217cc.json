(a) Consider a matrix A whose sparsity pattern is given by A =  × 0 × × × 0 0 × ×   . Here × stands for an arbitrary value, possibly nonzero, and 0 stands for a value that is necessarily zero. Write down the spar- sity patterns of the factors L and U that correspond to the LU decomposition of A. Assume no pivoting is done. There is no need to describe your steps or provide any explanations. (b) Given two nonsingular n × n matrices T and A, suppose the LU decomposition of T A is given: T A = LU, where as usual L is a unit lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. Assume no pivoting needs to be done. Suppose n is large and we now need to solve the linear system Ax = b, where A is the same matrix as above and b is a given right-hand side vector. Suggest a way to solve this system within O(n2) ﬂoating point operations. There is no need to provide a lengthy algorithm, just state what steps need to be taken and for each step state what the computational cost is. 2. A certain physical quantity behaves like the solution x of a linear system Ax = b. A physicist performs lab experiments and due to measurement errors a linear system Ay = c is obtained. It is known that ∥b − c∥ ≤ α · ∥b∥, where α is a known positive scalar. (a) Show that the absolute error satisﬁes ∥x − y∥ ≤ α · ∥A −1∥ · ∥b∥, for any norm. 1 (b) Find an upper bound, expressed in terms of α and the condition number of the matrix, κ(A), on the relative error ∥x − y∥ ∥x∥ . 3. Answer the following questions in one short sentence. (a) What does a semicolon at the end of a Matlab command signify? (b) What does a semicolon between elements of a matrix in Matlab signify? (c) Why does a large sparse matrix that is represented using Mat- lab’s sparse matrix features consume less memory than the stor- age it takes to store the same matrix in the dense format? (d) When we solve a linear system Ax = b, in what way is x = A\\b in Matlab diﬀerent than x = inv(A) ∗ b? (e) Suppose A is a rectangular full-rank matrix of size m-by-n, where m > n, and b is an m-long vector. What does the command x = A\\b in Matlab compute? 4. (a) A square matrix Q is orthogonal if Q T Q = QQT = I. Show that ∥Qx∥2 = ∥x∥2 for any vector x. (b) A symmetric matrix B is positive semideﬁnite if xT Bx ≥ 0 for any vector x. (As a reminder, B would be positive deﬁnite if xT Bx > 0 for any vector x ̸= 0.) Use this deﬁnition to show that if A is any matrix of dimensions m-by-n, with m > n, A T A is symmetric positive semideﬁnite. (c) Suppose A is a matrix of dimensions m-by-n, with m > n. Con- sider the linear system (A T A + γI)x = A T b, where γ is a positive scalar. Can the Cholesky decomposition be used to solve this linear system? Justify your answer. 5. Let F = I −2uu T with vector u such that ∥u∥2 = 1. Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false. There is no need to justify your answer. 2 (a) F is symmetric (b) F is symmetric positive deﬁnite (c) F is an orthogonal matrix (d) F is an orthogonal projector (e) F is nonsingular 3","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
