Compute the followings and write your answers in terms of ⃗r and ρ whenever possible. (a) ∇ρ (b) ∇ × ⃗r (c) ∇(ρ−1) (d) ∇ log ρ Solution. (a) ∇ρ = (∂xρ, ∂yρ, ∂zρ) = ( x ρ , y ρ , z ρ ) = ⃗r ρ . (b) ∇ × ⃗r = (∂2z − ∂3y, ∂3x − ∂1z, ∂1y − ∂2x) = ⃗0. (c) By Chain rule and (a), ∇(ρ−1) = −ρ−2∇ρ = −⃗r/ρ 3. (d) By Chain rule and (a), ∇ ln ρ = ρ −1∇ρ = ⃗r/ρ2 2. Let ⃗F = ⟨2xe−y, 2y − x2e −y⟩. (a) Determine if ⃗F is conservative or not. If conservative, ﬁnd a potential. (b) Compute the line integral I = ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r , where C is a line segment from (1, −1) to (2, 1). Solution. (a) Let F1 = 2xe −y and F2 = 2y − x2e−y. Note ∂1F2 = 0 − 2xe−y and ∂2F1 = −2xe−y. Since ∂1F2 = ∂2F1 holds on the entire simply-connected set R2, we know there exists a potential function. We now look for a potential f (x, y) so that ⃗F = ∇f . From the equation ∂1f = F1, we have f (x, y) = ∫ 2xe −ydx = x2e−y + h(y). Using the second equation ∂2f = F2 ∂2f = 2y − x2e−y = −x2e−y + h ′(y) Thus h ′(y) = 2y and h(y) = y2 + c. We can choose c = 0 and f (x, y) = x2e −y + y2 is a potential for the vector ﬁeld. Page 1 Math 317 Quiz 2 Practice Problems Solutions (b) By the fundamental theorem of line integrals, I = f (2, 1) − f (1, −1) = (4/e + 1) − (e + 1) = 4/e − e. Alternative way to compute I. Once we have showed that ⃗F is conservative, we can choose any path to evaluate I. For example we can choose C to be the union of C1 the line segment from (1, −1) to (2, −1), and C2 the line segment from (2, −1) to (2, 1). We have dy = 0 on C1 and dx = 0 on C2. Thus I = ∫ 2 1 2xedx + ∫ 1 −1(2y − 4e −y)dy = [x2e]2 1 + [y2 + 4e−y]1 −1 = [4 − 1]e + [1 + 4/e − (1 + 4e)] = 4/e − e. 3. Let ⃗F = ⟨e y, xe y + sin z, y cos z⟩. Find the work done by the force on an object that moves from (0, 0, 0) to (1, −1, 3). Solution. We attempt to ﬁnd a potential ϕ for the vector ﬁeld. It ϕ is a potential, then it must satisfy ϕ(x, y, z) = ∫ e ydx = xe y + f (y, z) ϕ(x, y, z) = ∫ xe y + sin zdy = xey + y sin z + g(x, z) ϕ(x, y, z) = ∫ y cos zdz = y sin z + h(x, y). Therefore, we observe that ϕ(x, y, z) = xe y + y sin z is a potential (with g(x, z) = 0, f (y, z) = y sin z and h(x, y) = xey). By the fundamental theorem of line integral, the work done is ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ϕ(1, −1, 3) − ϕ(0, 0, 0) = e −1 − sin 3. 4. For a constant A, suppose that the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y) = ⟨xye y, Ax 2e y(1 + y)⟩. has the path-independence property; the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r depends only on the endpoints of C. Determine the constant A. Solution. Since ⃗F(x, y) is continuous on R 2, we know that the path-independence property implies that ⃗F is conservative. Since ⃗F is conservative, it satisﬁes ∂1F2 = ∂2F1. We have ∂1F2 = 2Axey(1 + y) and ∂2F1 = xey + xye y = xe y(1 + y) by the product rule. Therefore, A = 1/2.

Compute the line integral ∫ C yzdx + xzdy + xydz, where C is the curve that consists of 3 line segments L1 from (0, 0, 0) to (2, 1, 2) and L2 from (2, 1, 2) to (9, 1, −1), and L3 from (9, 1, −1) to (0, 0, 0). Solution. Note that the vector ﬁeld is conservative; it has xyz as a potential. Since ⃗F is C 1 on R3, we can also conﬁrm this by checking that ∂iFj = ∂jFi. Next, observe that C is closed; (0, 0, 0) is both the initial and the terminal point. We know that the line integral of a conservative ﬁeld along any closed curve is 0. Therefore, the integral is 0. 6. Let ⃗F(x, y, z) = ⟨6x5y2z3, 2x6yz3, 3x6y2z2 + y⟩. (a) Compute curl ⃗F = ∇ × ⃗F. What can you say about ⃗F from the computation? (b) Let C be the line segment from (0, 1, 2) to (1, 3, 2). Compute the line integral∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r. (Hint: you may avoid a possibly tedious direct calculation.) Solution. (a) We have ∂1F2 = 12x5yz3 and ∂2F1 = 12x5yz3. In addition, ∂1F3 = 18x5y2z2 and ∂3F1 = 18x5y2z2. However, ∂2F3 = 6x6yz2 + 1, while ∂3F2 = 6x6yz2. Therefore, curl ⃗F = ⟨∂2F3 − ∂3F2, ∂3F1 − ∂1F3, ∂1F2 − ∂2F1⟩ = ⟨1, 0, 0⟩. Since curl ⃗F ̸= ⃗0, we conclude that ⃗F is not conservative. (b) The above calculation shows that ⃗F is “nearly” conservative; observe that if the y- term in F3 is removed, it would be conservative with a potential x6y2z3. Therefore, we may write ⃗F (x, y, z) = ∇(x6y2z3) + ⟨0, 0, y⟩. Using the fundamental theorem of line integrals, we compute ∫ C ∇(x6y2z3) · d⃗r = x6y2z3\f \f \f \f (1,3,2) (0,1,2) = 3 22 3 = 72. (1) For the non-conservative part ⟨0, 0, y⟩, we parametrize the line by ⃗r (t) = ⟨0, 1, 2⟩ + t⟨1, 2, 0⟩, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then ∫ C⟨0, 0, y⟩ · d⃗r = ∫ 1 0 ⟨0, 0, 2t + 1⟩ · ⟨1, 2, 0⟩dt = 0. (2) Combining (1) and (2), we get ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ C ∇(x6y2z3) · d⃗r + ∫ C⟨0, 0, y⟩ · d⃗r = 72 + 0 = 72. Page 3","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
