October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 2 of 5 1. Consider the following initial value problem: { y′ + xy = x3, y(0) = 1. (1) (a)(4 points) Use the integrating factor method to express the solution to problem (1) in terms of an indeﬁnite integral with a constant of integration. Answer. This is a linear inhomogeneous equation. The integrating factor is r = ex2/2. Thus, d dx (e x2 2 y) = e x2 2 x 3. The solution is then given by: Solution: y = e− x2 2 ∫ e x2 2 x3dx + Ce − x2 2 . (b)(4 points) Evaluate the integral and the constant of integration to ﬁnd an explicit solution to problem (1). Answer. We can integrate the r.h.s. using integration by parts with u = x2, dv = xe x2 2 so du = 2x, v = ex2/2: ∫ e x2 2 x3dx = x 2e x2/2 − ∫ 2xex2/2xdx = x2e x2/2 − 2e x2/2. Plugging this into the expression from part (a) we have y = x 2 − 2 + Ce −x2/2. We then plug in 1 = 02 − 2 + C so C = 3, and Solution: y = x2 − 2 + 3e −x2/2 (c)(2 points) What is the maximum interval of existence for the solution of part (a)? Answer. Solution: The solution exists for all x, that is (−∞, ∞) or R. October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 3 of 5 2. (a)(5 points) Solve the diﬀerential equation implicitly: y′ = 4 x(2 − y2) , with y(1) = 1. (2) Answer. Separate variables: (2 − y2)y′ = 4 x so: 2y − 1 3 y3 = 4 ln(x) + C. Solving for C we ﬁnd: 2 − 1 3 = C, so C = 5 3 . Solution: 2y − 1 3 y3 = 4 ln(x) + 5 3 . (b)(5 points) Use Euler’s method with constant step size h = 1 2 to approximate the solution at y = 2. Answer. For the ﬁrst step: y(1.5) ≈ y1 = 1 + 1 2 4 (1)(2 − 1) = 1 + 2 = 3. y(2) ≈ y2 = 3 + 1 2 4 ( 3 2 )(2 − 32) = 3 + 2 3 2 (2 − 9) = 3 + −4 21 = 59 21 . Solution: y(2) ≈ 59 21 . October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 4 of 5 3. Let k be a real constant, consider the following diﬀerential equation: (2x2 + y) + (x2y + kx)y′ = 0, for x > 0. (3) (a)(4 points) Find the value of k such that r(x) = 1 x2 is an integrating factor for the equation (3). Answer. Multiply r(x) = 1 x2 on the both sides of (3), then (2 + y x2 ) + (y + k x ) y′ = 0. Since r(x) = 1 x2 is an integrating factor for (3), then we have ∂ ∂y (2 + y x2 ) = ∂ ∂x (y + k x ) . Hence we get 1 x2 = − k x2 , which implies that Solution: k = −1. (b)(6 points) When k takes the value found in the previous part, ﬁnd the solution to the problem (3) with the initial value condition y(1) = 2. (You can keep the implicit form of the solution) Answer. By the result of part (a), we know that k = −1 and (2 + y x2 ) + ( y − 1 x ) y′ = 0 is exact, which implies that there exists some function ϕ(x, y) such that • ϕx(x, y) = 2 + y x2 and ϕy(x, y) = y − 1 x . • the solutions to the diﬀerential equation is given by ϕ(x, y) = C. Since ϕx(x, y) = 2 + y x2 , then: ϕ(x, y) = ∫ (2 + y x2 ) dx + f (y) = 2x − y x + f (y). Take the partial derivative with respect to y, then ϕy(x, y) = − 1 x + f ′(y). Since ϕy(x, y) = y − 1 x , then y − 1 x = − 1 x + f ′(y). That is, f ′(y) = y, which implies that we can take f (y) = y2 2 . So we get ϕ(x, y) = 2x − y x + y2 2 = C. Since y(1) = 2, then 2 − 2 + 2 = C, that is, C = 2. So Solution: 2x − y x + y2 2 = 2 October 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm 1 Page 5 of 5 4. (a)(7 points) Consider the following autonomous diﬀerential equation: y′ = y(y + 1)2(y − 2). (4) Draw the phase diagram of the problem (4), and classify the critical points of the problem (4) stable or unstable. Answer. The ﬁxed points of f (y) = y(y + 1)2(y − 2) are y = −1, y = 0 and y = 2. Since f (y) > 0 for y > 2 and it changes sign across y = 2 and y = 0, but not across y = −1, we get the phase diagram: s −1 s 0 s 2 ▲ ▲ ▼ ▲ Solution: So we know that y = 2 is unstable, y = 0 is stable, and y = −1 is unstable. (b)(3 points) It’s known that y1(x) = 2x and y2(x) = 2x + 2e−x2 are two solutions to the diﬀerential equation y′ = 2 + 4x2 − 2xy. Let g(x) be the solution to the initial value problem: { y′ = 2 + 4x2 − 2xy, y(0) = 1. (5) Explain why y1(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ y2(x) for all x > 0. Find the limit lim x→∞ g(x) x and explain why. (Hint: Existence and uniqueness theorem) Answer. Let f (x, y) = 2 + 4x2 − 2xy, then fy(x, y) = −2x. Both f (x, y) and fy(x, y) are continuous for all x and y, so we can apply the existence and uniqueness theorem for all initial values. Since y1(0) = 0, g(0) = 1 and y2(0) = 2, and solution graphs do not intersect by the uniqueness theorem, we know that y1(x) < g(x) < y2(x) for all x ∈ R. That is, 2x < g(x) < 2x + 2e−x2, for all x ∈ R. So we get 2 < g(x) x < 2 + 2e−x2 x , for all x > 0. By squeeze theorem, lim x→∞ g(x) x = 2. A common error is to say g is a linear combination of y1 and y2. Superposition principle does not hold for nonhomogeneous linear ODE.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
