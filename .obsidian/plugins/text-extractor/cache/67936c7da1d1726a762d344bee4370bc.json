Poet and Helix have the right idea. Here's my explanation (which is redundant but | guess maybe a third explanation could help someone triangulate...) For each v in V/, consider the s in S’ that minimizes d[v][s] (in other words, find the s that is closest to v). So each location v is paired with a particular stand s (the closest stand to this particular location). From these (v, s) pairs, take the pair (v*, s*) with the maximum distance d[v*][s°]. This maximum distance d[v*][s*] should be < b. Basically, the maximum distance from any location v to its closest stand s is at most b. thanks! |1 Updated 23 hours ago by Jamie Kai followup discussions, for lingering questions and comments LN VISR @627_f1 ‘} Anonymous Helix 1 day ago L.®_] Idon't want to say for sure yet but that seems right to me. Maybe to make it a bit clearer, instead of “take the minimum distance from it to every stand in S*, you could word it as “take the minimum possible distance from it to some stand in S'\"? helpfull |0","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
