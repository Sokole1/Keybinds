Therefore, for each column we replace the loop in the standard GE algorithm by a single operation of computing the multiplier. In the algorithm provided below we have an n x n upper Hessenberg matrix H as input, and overwrite the upper triangular part of H by U, and the subdiagonal by the multipliers.

For example, for n =5 we have x 0 0 0 0 x x 0 0 0 L=|0 x x 0 0]. 0 0 x x 0 0 0 0 x x (c) It takes O(n?) flops to form the LU decomposition, O(n) flops to do forward substitution Ly = b (since L is lower bidiagonal), and O(n?) to do backward substitution, Uz = y. So, the overall amount of work is O(n?) flops. (d) If row partial pivoting in its simplest form is done, then at each step there is only one candidate to choose as an alternative pivot. The matrix L such that PA = LU will be unit lower triangular, but its elements below the main diagonal may be row-permuted. Thus, there is only one nonzero element l; x, i > k for each column 1 < k < n — 1, but the nonzero element is not necessarily the one below the main diagonal, i.e., it is no longer true that i = k+ 1. On the other hand, the matrix U is simply a dense upper triangular matrix.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
