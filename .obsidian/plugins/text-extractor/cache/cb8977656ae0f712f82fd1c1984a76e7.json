A company that deals with certain fluid flow problems needs to solve an n x n linear system as follows: it is a linear system that was originally tridiagonal, but a physical condition needs to be imposed, which needs to replace either the first equation or the last equation, and it looks as follows: a1xy + oz + o+ apzy =1, where a; # 0, i = 1,...,n. The values of ; can be changed accord- ing to whether the first equation is modified or the last equation is modified, and either way the modified matrix will be diagonally domi- nant and no pivoting will be required. The company has approached a student who has recently successfully completed CPSC 302 and asked for their advice on whether they should replace the first or the last equation. The value of n is very large, and the company is concerned primarily about computational cost. What would your advice to the company be?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
