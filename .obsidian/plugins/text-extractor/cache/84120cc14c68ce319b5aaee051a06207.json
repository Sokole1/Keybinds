(6 points) Consider the linear least-squares problem min b — Ax]lz, x where A is a full rank m x n matrix, with m > n. Suppose we are using the normal equations, and the matrix of the linear system has been slightly perturbed, as follows: instead of solving AT Ax = ATb, we solve (ATA+ E)(x+y) = ATb, where E is a matrix and y is a vector, with ||E|| and ||y|| very small. That is, we refer to (x+y) as the solution of this modified linear system. (a) Suppose Ey is so small that it can be neglected. Show that y=—(ATA)Ex.
