Cache A has 1024 cache sets and a 32-byte cache line size. Cache B is a 512 KB cache with 32 byte cache lines. We first focus on Cache A. Give a mask in hexadecimal that will keep only the index bits for Cache A from an address. Ox integer in base 16 (-] Consider the following specific address in hexadecimal: 0xfb7b3b02. Give the exact index bits from this address in binary for Cache A. (For example, if there were 40 address bits of which 21 were index bits, your answer would have exactly 21 bits.) Ob integer in base 2 (-] Now we focus on Cache B instead. How many bits will be used for the index in Cache B if it is direct-mapped? integer @ How many bits will be used for the index in Cache B if it is 16-way set-associative? integer @ How many bits will be used for the index in Cache B if it is fully-associative? integer @ Additional attempts available with new variants @","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
