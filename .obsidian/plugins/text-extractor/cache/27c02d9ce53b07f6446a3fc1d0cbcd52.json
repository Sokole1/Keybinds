(a) Estimate the condition number of the problem of evaluating f near z = 0 and show that this problem is well-conditioned. (b) Write down the first three terms of the Taylor series of this function about 2o = 0. (c) Compute the backward error and the forward error for 2 = 0.05, using a Taylor series. (d) Is the algorithm of using the three terms of the Taylor series numerically stable?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
