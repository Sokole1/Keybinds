(If @ = b then they are precisely parallel and there is no solution.) For both & and y the denominator is very small, and cancellation error when computing it may be magnified by the subsequent division. (b) Cpiy___@ b b-a 1 PTETY T T TR T R-a bta Calculating the rightmost expression directly, for any a # b, avoids the trouble because the damaging factor b — a has been explicitly cancelled out. (c) The statement is true. When solving the system we encounter the difficulties stated in (a) and nothing much can be done. But for computing z = 1/(a + b), as done in (b), there is no difficulty so long as a # b.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
