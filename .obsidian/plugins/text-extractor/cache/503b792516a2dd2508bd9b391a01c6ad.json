Suppose you wish to measure the friction a mass of 0.1 kg experiences as it slides along a floor (you wish to find ¢). You have a spring with spring constant k = 5 /... You take the spring, you attach it to the mass and fix it to a wall. Then you pull on the spring and let the mass go. You find that the mass oscillates with frequency 1 Hz. What is the friction? v Answer., | ¢ = y/4km — 4w?m? ~ 0.659 N.s/m.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
