(a) For the gambler’s ruin problem, let M; denote the expected number of games that will be played when Gambler initially has $; ( =0,1,...,N). Let ¢ = 1 — p. Show that Moy=My=0, M;j=1+pMiy1+qM;_y (i=1,...,N—1). Hint: Compute the expectation of the number of games X by conditioning on the outcome of the first game: EX = E[X|win first game]P(win first game) + E[X |lose first game]P(lose first game).

First, find the general solution to the homogeneous equation M; = pM;1+qM;_; (already done in class). Next, find a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation M; = 1+pM; 1 +qM;_; (try M; = ci for p # % and M; = ci? forp = %; find ¢ that produces a solution). Add the general solution of the homogeneous equation to the particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation. Finally, solve for the two unknown constants in the general solution by using the boundary conditions.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
