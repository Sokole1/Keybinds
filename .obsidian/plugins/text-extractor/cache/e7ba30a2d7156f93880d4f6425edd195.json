What is best to do? @ Compute all the singular values of the matrix A using SVD and identify the largest one. @ Compute all the eigenvalues of the matrix AT A; the largest singular value of A is the square of the largest eigenvalue. @ Apply power method to the matrix A; the largest singular value can be estimated using the corresponding Rayleigh Quotient. @ Apply power method to the matrix AT A and take the square root of the corresponding Rayleigh Quotient. @ Compute the determinant of A and take a square root.
