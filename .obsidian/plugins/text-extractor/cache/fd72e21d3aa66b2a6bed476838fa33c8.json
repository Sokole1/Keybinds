(a) Show that the probability ps,, that a walker returns to its starting place at the origin after 2n steps is given by pan = = (3\") Yoo (1) (b) Show that Y>¢_o()? = (2*). Hint: Think of choosing n balls from a box that has 2n balls, n white and n black. (c) Conclude that py, ~ L as n — cc. (d) Conclude that the two-dimensional walk is recurrent. Note: the combination of parts (a) and (b) shows that the 2-dimensional return probability is the square of its 1-dimensional counterpart. An explanation of this is presented in Section 2.3.6 of Doyle and Snell https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0001057.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
