Select from the following list of statements those that are true. (Recall that the 3SAT problem is NP-complete.) (O 3SAT does not have a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if P # NP. O IfP = NP then the problem of determining whether an undirected, unweighted graph is connected is NP-complete. O Ifthereisa polynomial-time reduction from decision problem X to 3SAT (i.e., X <, 3SAT), then X must be in NP. O Ifthereisa polynomial-time reduction from decision problem 3SAT to X (i.e., 3SAT <, X), then X must be NP-complete. O If there is no polynomial-time reduction from decision problem X to 3SAT (i.e., it is not the case that X <, 3SAT), then X cannot be in NP.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
