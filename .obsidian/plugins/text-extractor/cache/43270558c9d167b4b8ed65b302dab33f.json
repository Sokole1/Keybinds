November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 2 of 6 1. (a)(6 points) Use the method of undetermined coeﬃcients to ﬁnd a particular solution to the diﬀerential equation: y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 5 sin(x). Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 0 is r2 + 2r + 2 = 0, then r1 = −1 + i and r2 = −1 − i. Let yp(x) = A cos(x) + B sin(x) be a particular solution to y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = 5 sin(x), then y′ p(x) = −A sin(x) + B cos(x), and y′′ p (x) = −A cos(x) − B sin(x). Then we have y′′ p + 2y′ p + 2yp = −A cos(x) − B sin(x) + 2(−A sin(x) + B cos(x)) + 2(A cos(x) + B sin(x)) = −A cos(x) − B sin(x) − 2A sin(x) + 2B cos(x) + 2A cos(x) + 2B sin(x) = (A + 2B) cos(x) + (B − 2A) sin(x) = 5 sin(x). So we have A + 2B = 0, and B − 2A = 5. Hence A = −2 and B = 1. Then we have yp(x) = −2 cos(x) + sin(x). (b)(7 points) Use the method of variation of parameters to ﬁnd a particular solution to problem: y′′ − y = 2e −x. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − y = 0 is r2 − 1 = 0, then r1 = 1 and r2 = −1. So the general solution to y′′ − y = 0 is yc(x) = C1ex + C2e−x. Now let yp(x) = u1(x)ex + u2(x)e−x be a particular solution to y′′ − y = 2e−x for some functions. By the method of variation of parameters, we have u ′ 1(x)e x + u ′ 2(x)e−x = 0 u ′ 1(x)e x − u ′ 2(x)e−x = 2e−x. So we get u ′ 1(x) = e−2x, and u ′ 2(x) = −1. So we can take u1(x) = ∫ e −2x dx = − 1 2 e−2x, and u2(x) = − ∫ 1 dx = −x. Hence we know that yp(x) = u1(x)ex + u2(x)e−x = − 1 2 e−2x · ex − xe−x = − 1 2 e −x − xe−x. November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 3 of 6 2.(7 points) Find a particular solution to the problem: y′′ − 3y′ = 2e x − 6x. Hint: You can use either method of undetermined coeﬃcients or variation of parameters. Answer. Method I: The characteristic equation of y′′ − 3y′ = 0 is r2 − 3r = 0, then r1 = 0 and r2 = 3. Let yp(x) = Aex + x(Bx + C) = Aex + Bx2 + Cx be a solution to y′′ − 3y′ = 2ex − 6x, then y′ p(x) = Ae x + 2Bx + C, and y′′ p (x) = Ae x + 2B So we get y′′ p − 3y′ p = Aex + 2B − 3(Ae x + 2Bx + C) = Aex + 2B − 3Aex − 6Bx − 3C = −2Ae x − 6Bx + 2B − 3C = 2ex − 6x. So we get −2A = 2, 6B = 6, 2B − 3C = 0. So A = −1, B = 1 and C = 2 3 . Hence the solution is: yp(x) = −ex + x2 + 2 3 x. Method II: The characteristic equation of y′′ − 3y′ = 0 is r2 − 3r = 0, then r1 = 0 and r2 = 3. So the general solution to y′′ − 3y′ = 0 is yc(x) = C1 + C2e3x. Now let yp(x) = u1(x) + u2(x)e3x be a particular solution to y′′ − 3y′ = 2ex−6 for some functions. By the method of variation of parameters, we have u ′ 1(x) + u ′ 2(x)e 3x = 0 3u ′ 2(x)e3x = 2e x − 6x. So we get u ′ 1(x) = − 2 3 e x + 2x, and u ′ 2(x) = 2 3 e−2x − 2xe−3x. So we can take u1(x) = ∫ [− 2 3 ex + 2x] dx = − 2 3 ex + x2 u2(x) = ∫ [ 2 3 e−2x − 2xe−3x] dx = − 1 3 e−2x + 2 3 xe−3x + 2 9 e−3x. Hence we know that yp(x) = u1(x) + u2(x)e3x = − 2 3 ex + x2 + e3x [− 1 3 e−2x + 2 3 xe−3x + 2 9 e −3x] = −e x + x2 + 2 3 x + 2 9 . November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 4 of 6 3.(10 points) Use the Laplace transform to solve the following initial value problem: y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = δ(t − 1), y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 2. Answer. Let Y (s) = L[y(t)](s), apply the Laplace transform on the both sides of y′′ + 2y′ + 2y = δ(t − 1), then L[y′′] + 2L[y′] + 2L[y] = L[δ(t − 1)]. By the transform of derivatives, since y(0) = 1 and y′(0) = 0, then L[y′′] = s 2L[y] − sy(0) − y′(0) = s 2Y (s) − s − 2, and L[y′] = sL[y] − y(0) = sY (s) − 1. By looking up the table, we know that L[δ(t − 1)] = e−s. So we get s2Y (s) − s − 2 + 2sY (s) − 2 + 2Y (s) = e −s. So we get Y (s) = s + 4 + e−s s2 + 2s + 2 = s + 4 s2 + 2s + 2 + e−s s2 + 2s + 2 . Notice that s2 + 2s + 2 = (s + 1)2 + 1, by the ﬁrst and second shifting properties, we have y(t) = L −1[Y (s)](t) = L −1 [ s + 1 + 3 (s + 1)2 + 1 ] (t) + L −1 [ e−s (s + 1)2 + 1 ] (t) = e−tL−1 [ s + 3 s2 + 1 ] (t) + u(t − 1)L−1 [ 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 ] (t − 1) = e−t [L −1 [ s s2 + 1 ] (t) + L −1 [ 3 s2 + 1 ] (t)] + u(t − 1)e −(t−1) sin(t − 1) = e−t[cos(t) + 3 sin(t)] + u(t − 1)e −(t−1) sin(t − 1). November 2015 Math 215/255 Midterm 2 Page 5 of 6 4. (a)(5 points) Use the Laplace transform and convolution to ﬁnd the solution to x′′ + x = f (t) subject to initial value conditions x(0) = 0 and x′(0) = 3. Here f (t) is any function and your solution should be in terms of certain integrals of f (t). Answer. Let X(s) = L[x(t)](s) and F (s) = L[f (t)](s), apply the Laplace transform on the both sides of x′′ + x = f (t), then L[x′′] + L[x] = L[f (t)](s) = F (s). By the transform of derivative, then L[x′′] = s 2L[x] − sx(0) − x ′(0) = s2X(s) − 3, and L[x ′] = sL[x] − x(0) = sX(s). Hence we get s2X(s) − 3 + X(s) = F (s), which implies that X(s) = F (s) + 3 s2 + 1 = F (s) s2 + 1 + 3 s2 + 1 . By looking up the table, we know that L −1 [ 1 s2 + 1 ] (t) = sin(t). By the transform of convolution, we know that x(t) = L−1[X(s)](t) = L −1 [F (s) · 1 s2 + 1 + 3 s2 + 1 ] (t) = L−1[F (s)] ∗ L −1 [ 1 s2 + 1 ] (t) + 3 sin(t) = ∫ t 0 f (τ ) sin(t − τ ) dτ + 3 sin(t). (b)(5 points) Find the Laplace transform of f (t) = { t, if 0 ≤ t < 1, 2 − t, if t ≥ 1. . Answer. It’s easy to see that f (t) = t[u(t − 0) − u(t − 1)] + (2 − t)[u(t − 1) − u(t − ∞)] = t − tu(t − 1) + (2 − t)u(t − 1) = t + (2 − 2t)u(t − 1) = t − 2(t − 1)u(t − 1). By the second shifting property, we have L[f (t)](s) = L[t] − 2L[(t − 1)u(t − 1)] = 1 s2 − 2e−sL[t](s) = 1 s2 − 2e−s s2 .
