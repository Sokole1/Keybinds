Question: 1 2 3 Total Points: 4 8 8 20 Score: CPSC 302: Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems Midterm Exam 1 Question 1. (4 points) Determine whether the following statements are true or false. There is no need to justify your answer; just write T/F at a visible place. (a)1 pt The result of the computation x = 1/0 - 1/0 in Matlab is x=0. (b)1 pt Denote by cm the smallest positive number on the IEEE 754 double precision ﬂoating point system. Then the ﬂoating point representation of 1 + cm is 1, that is, ﬂ(1 + cm) = 1. (c)1 pt If a continuous function with a continuous derivative has two distinct ﬁxed points in an interval and a ﬁxed-point iteration is applied, then if the iterative scheme converges to one of the ﬁxed points, it does not necessarily converge to the ﬁxed point that is closer to the initial guess. (d)1 pt If the secant method is applied to compute the zero of the function f (x) = x2, which is x∗ = 0, it will always fail to converge regardless of the initial guesses, because f ′(x∗) = 0. You may use the space below to write notes, state your assumptions, or make a comment, but only your T/F answers will be marked. Page 1 of 6 CPSC 302: Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems Midterm Exam 1 Question 2. (8 points) The IEEE 754 single precision ﬂoating point system uses base β = 2 and has 23 bits in its signiﬁcand (mantissa), plus one more leading bit which is not explicitly stored. It has 8 bits for the exponent and one bit for the sign, for a total of 32 bits. The rounding unit is approximately equal to 5.96×10−8 and the largest ﬁnite positive number that can be represented on the system is approximately 3.4 × 1038. All integers with seven or fewer decimal digits can be converted exactly into a single precision value. The solution of a quadratic equation ax2 +bx+c = 0 where a ̸= 0, is given by x± = −b± √b2−4ac 2a . The following two Matlab scripts were executed for solving the equation, using single precision: Script 1: a=single(1); b=single(-1e6); c=single(1); xp=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a); xm=(-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a); The results of the computation for Script 1 are: xp=1.0000e+6, xm=0 (in single precision). The correct results in this case are approximately xp=1.0000e+6 and xm=1.0000e-06. Therefore the approximation obtained by xp is ﬁne but the approximation obtained by xm is uninformative, without meaningful correct decimal digits. Script 2: a=single(1); b=single(-1e20); c=single(1); xp=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a); xm=(-b-sqrt(b^2-4*a*c))/(2*a); The results of the computation for Script 2 are: xp=Inf, xm=-Inf (in single precision). The correct results in this case are approximately xp=1.0000e+20 and xm=1.0000e-20. Therefore, the results for both xp and xm are incorrect, Note that b in both scripts is negative. (a)4 pts Explain the results. What goes wrong in each of the two scripts and why? Page 2 of 6 CPSC 302: Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems Midterm Exam 1 (b)4 pts Suppose you are involved in writing a robust quadratic equation solver, as a Matlab function that gets the parameters a, b, and c as input and computes the xp and xm. Suggest numerically suitable formulas that address the situations encountered in this question and would result in computing more accurate results on this ﬂoating point system for the values of a, b, and c in Scripts 1 and 2. There is no need to use Matlab syntax. Page 3 of 6 CPSC 302: Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems Midterm Exam 1 Question 3. (8 points) The hyperbolic tangent function is given by tanh(x) = ex − e−x ex + e−x . A graph of this function on the interval [−3, 3] is given below: -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 x -1 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1y y=tanh(x) The value of the function at 0 is 0: tanh(0) = 0. (a)2 pts Suppose we are interested in computing the function value accurately (on the given ﬂoating point system) for small values of x ̸= 0 and we do not have access to the tanh library function. If we use Matlab to compute tanh(x) based on the exponential function using the above formula, we notice that the command y=(exp(x)-exp(-x))/(exp(x)+exp(-x)) gives y=0 when x is very small. This is an unsatisfying evaluation of the function y = tanh(x) for x ̸= 0, as there are no meaningful correct decimal digits in this approximation. Show, using Taylor series, that tanh(x) ≈ x for x very small, and therefore the value of x itself is an eﬀective approximation of tanh(x) for x ≪ 1. If it helps, the ﬁrst few terms of the Taylor series of a function f (x) about 0 are given by f (x) = f (0)+f ′(0)x+ f ′′(0) 2 x2+. . . , and the derivative of the speciﬁc function f (x) = tanh(x) is f ′(x) = 1 − tanh 2(x). You may assume that x is so small that values such as x2, x3, or similar may be ignored. Page 4 of 6 CPSC 302: Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems Midterm Exam 1 (b)1 pt Suppose we wish to compute the zero of the function f (x) = tanh(x) (which is x∗ = 0) using Newton’s method. Write down the Newton iteration. There is no need to simplify the formula. (If it helps, the derivative of the function is given in part (a) of this question.) (c)2 pts For initial guesses x0 = 1 and x0 = 2 the Newton iteration was carried out with a standard stopping criterion, and the iterates were recorded. Here are the results for x0 = 1: k 0 1 2 3 4 5 xk 1 -0.8134 0.4094 -0.0473 7.0603e-05 -2.3463e-13 Here are the results for x0 = 2: k 0 1 2 3 4 xk 2 -11.6450 3.2555e+09 -Inf NaN For each of the cases, determine the convergence of the scheme, as follows: CIRCLE ONE: (no justiﬁcation required) ‹ Scheme for x0 = 1: converges linearly / converges quadratically / does not converge ‹ Scheme for x0 = 2: converges linearly / converges quadratically / does not converge Page 5 of 6 CPSC 302: Numerical Computation for Algebraic Problems Midterm Exam 1 (d)2 pts For each of the initial guesses, provide a clear explanation that clariﬁes why we see the results given in part(c). It is okay to make observations on the graph of the function in your answer, but make sure to give a full answer. There is no need to provide a rigorous proof of any sort, just focus on things like function values and derivative values at relevant points of interest, and so on. (e)1 pt Can the bisection method be successfully applied in this case to ﬁnd the zero of the function with an initial interval of your choice contained in [−3, 3]? Assume that as your initial interval you may select an interval [a, b] of your choice such that a, b ̸= 0 and −3 ≤ a < b ≤ 3. Justify your answer. You may use the graph to provide a justiﬁcation.
