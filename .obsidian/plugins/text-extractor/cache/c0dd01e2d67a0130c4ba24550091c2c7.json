Assume boundary conditions are C(0, t) = C(a, t) = 0, t > 0, and the initial concentration is given by C(x, 0) = f (x), 0 < x < a. (a) Use the method of separation of variables to solve for the concentration C(x, t). (b) What happens to the concentration as t → ∞? (c) What is the concentration C(x, t) if the initial condition is C(x, 0) = cos(πx/a)? Hint: It may be useful to know that ˆ a 0 sin(nπx/a) cos(πx/a) dx = { 0, if n is odd 2an π(n2−1) , if n is even SOLUTION: (a) Use the method of separation of variables to solve for the concentration C(x, t). We use separation of variables. Let C(x, t) = X(x)T (t). Then Ct = kCxx − LC becomes X(x)T ′(t) = kX ′′(x)T (t) − LX(x)T (t). We divide both sides by kX(x)T (t) and re-arrange to obtain: 1 k T ′ T = X ′′ X − L k = ˜λ, (1) or 1 k T ′ T + L k = X ′′ X = λ, (2) where ˜λ, λ are constant. We could use either (1 or 2) to get the solution. Since using (2) is more straight- forward, that's what we'll use. 2 What happens to the boundary conditions under the separation of variables? 0 = C(0, t) = X(0)T (t) ⇒ X(0) = 0 (since T (t) won ′t be 0 for allt) 0 = C(a, t) = X(a)T (t) ⇒ X(a) = 0 (since T (t) won ′t be 0 for allt) So we have X(0) = X(2) = 0. Can the initial condition tell us anything at this stage? f (x) = C(x, 0) = X(x)T (t) ⇒ T (t) = f (x)/X(x)??? No, it can't. The trick worked on the boundary conditions b/c they were homogeneous ( = 0). We'll actually use the initial condition at the end to solve for constants. Let's start with the T -equation from (2): T ′(t) = (λk − L)T (t). Solving, we notice that this is a separable equation dT dt = (λk − L)T ⇒ dT T = (λk − L)dt. Integrating both sides, ˆ dT T = ˆ (λk − L)dt ⇒ ln(T ) = (λk − L)t + B ⇒ T (t) = Be(λk−L)t, taking the exponential of both sides. B is an arbitrary constant. Next we deal with the X-equation in (2) with conditions X(0) = X(a) = 0 derived from the boundary conditions X ′′ = λX X(0) = X(a) = 0. This is an eigenvalue problem . There are 3 cases to consider: λ > 0, λ = 0, and λ < 0. We begin with the λ > 0: set λ = µ 2 > 0. Then X ′′(x) − µ 2X(x) = 0. Use the substitution X(x) = erx to get the characteristic equation r2 − µ 2 = 0, which has roots r = ±µ.Thus X(x) = C1eµx + C2e−µx. We now use the boundary conditions to ˝nd constants such that the conditions are satis˝ed: X(0) = 0 ⇒ B1 + B2 = 0 X(a) = 0 ⇒ B1eaµ + B2e−aµ = 0. Solving simultaneously we ˝nd B1 = B2 = 0. (The ˝rst equation gives B2 = −B1, plugging into the ˝rst equation gives B1e2µ − B1e −2µ = 0 ⇒ B1(e2µ − e−2µ) = 0, and this means that B1 = 0 because e2µ − e−2µis only zero at µ = 0, which it isn't here - µ 2 = λ > 0). Thus we have recovered the trivial solution (aka zero solution). Therefore for λ > 0 we have no eigenvalues or eigenfunctions. Next we consider the λ = 0 case (we could consider it jointly with the λ < 0 or λ > 0 cases, if we're very careful, but for the purposes of a systematic approach we won't here). Then X ′′ = 0 ⇒ X(x) = Dx + E. Applying boundary conditions, 0 = X(0) = E ⇒ E = 0; 0 = X(a) = Da ⇒ D = 0. Thus we have recovered the trivial solution (aka zero solution). Therefore for λ = 0 we have no eigenvalues or eigenfunctions. Finally we look at the λ < 0 case. Set λ = −µ 2 < 0. Then X ′′(x) + µ 2X(x) = 0. Use the substitution X(x) = erx to get the characteristic equation r2 + µ 2 = 0, which has roots r = ±iµ.Thus X(x) = ˜B1eiµx + ˜B2e−iµx or X(x) = B1 sin(µx) + B2 cos(µx) (for more details on solving this ode, see your textbook, section 3.3). We now use the boundary conditions to ˝nd constants such that the conditions are satis˝ed: X(0) = 0 ⇒ B1 sin(0) + B2 cos(0) = 0 ⇒ B2 = 0 X(2) = 0 ⇒ B1 sin(aµ) = 0. 3 Since sin(θ) has roots at θ = nπ, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , the second condition tells us that aµ = nπ or µ = nπ/a, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . Thus we have our eigenfunctions an eigenvalues for λ < 0: λn = − ( nπ a )2 Xn(x) = sin(nπx/a). Now we re-assemble. Recall C(x, t) = X(x)T (t). Therefore Cn(x, t) = Xn(x)Tn(t) = sin ( nπx a ) exp [ − ( n2π2 a2 k + L ) t] for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . are each solutions to the pde. The pde is linear so we can use the principle of superposition, and sum them to make up a general solution: C(x, t) = ∞∑ n=1 bn sin ( nπx a ) exp [ − ( n2π2 a2 k + L ) t ] , where the bn are constants. We solve for the bn using the initial condition. That is, C(x, 0) = f (x) so f (x) = ∞∑ n=1 bn sin ( nπx a ) , which is a Fourier sine series. We exploit orthogonality of the sines, that is, ˆ L 0 sin ( nπx L ) sin ( mπx L ) dx = { 0, m ̸= n L/2, m = n where L = a to solve for the individual bn: bn = 2 a ˆ a 0 f (x) sin ( nπx a ) dx since L = a. And that's it! We don't know f (x) (yet), so we're done. The concentration C(x, t) is C(x, t) = ∞∑ n=1 bn sin ( nπx a ) exp [− ( n2π2 a2 k + L ) t] , with bn = 2 a ˆ a 0 f (x) sin ( nπx a ) dx. (b) What happens to the concentration as t → ∞? Well, lim t→∞ exp [ − ( n 2π2 a2 k + L ) t] = 0. Therefore, as t → ∞, the concentration C(x, t) → 0. Which makes sense! The equation describes the di˙usion of a chemical through a thin layer. Eventually, it all di˙uses through, so the concentration goes to zero. (c) What is the concentration C(x, t) if the initial condition is C(x, 0) = cos(πx/a)? We use the initial condition to ˝nd bn. bn = 2 a ˆ a 0 f (x) sin ( nπx a ) dx = 2 a ˆ a 0 cos ( πx a ) sin ( nπx a ) dx. We are given a hint, that ˆ a 0 sin ( nπx a ) cos ( πx a ) dx = { 0, if n is odd 2an π(n2−1) , if n is even 4 Then bn = 2 a ˆ a 0 sin ( nπx a ) cos ( πx a ) dx = { 0, if n is odd 4n π(n2−1) , if n is even Therefore in the sum we only have the even terms. The odd-indexed coe˚cients b2m+1 = 0, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; the even-indexed coe˚cients are, for m = 1, 2, 3, . . . b2m = 4(2m) π((2m)2 − 1) = 8m π(4m2 − 1) . Thus the concentration C(x, t) is: C(x, t) = 8 π ∞∑ m=1 m 4m2 − 1 sin ( 2mπx a ) exp [ − ( 4m 2π2 a2 k + L) t ] . \u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016\u0016- Problem 3: Find the Fourier Sine series of period 2π of the following function. Sketch the graph of the function to which the series converges (sketch at least three periods). f (x) = { 1, 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2 0, π/2 ≤ x ≤ π SOLUTION: Remember, the Fourier sine series of a function gives the odd periodic extension. That is, the function over [0, L] is considered to be HALF of an odd function of which we want to take a periodic extension. The period of the odd periodic extension, of the Fourier sine series, is 2L. Here, L = π - which means that, when we calculate the Fourier sine series, it is automatically of period 2π! We are asked to ˝nd a Fourier sine series of a function over [0, π] ( L = π). The Fourier sine series is de˝ned as f (x) = ∞∑ n=1 bn sin ( nπx L ) where bn = 2 L ˆ L 0 f (x) sin ( nπx L ) dx. Since here L = π, our series will take the form f (x) = ∞∑ n=1 bn sin (nx) where bn = 2 L ˆ π 0 f (x) sin (nx) dx. All that's left to calculate are the coe˚cients bn. bn = 2 π ˆ π 0 f (x) sin(nx) dx = 2 π ˆ π/2 0 (1) sin(nx) dx + 2 π ˆ π π/2(0) sin(nx) dx = 2 π [ − 1 n cos(nx) \f \f \f \f π/2 0 ] bn = 2 nπ [1 − cos ( nπ 2 )] . This needs to be further dissected. First note that for n odd, cos(nπ/2) = 0. So let's consider the odd ( n = 2m − 1, m = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) and even indices ( n = 2m, m = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) separately. That is, f (x) = ∞∑ n=1 bn sin(nx) = ∞∑ m=1 b2m−1 sin((2m − 1)x) + ∞∑ m=1 b2m sin(2mx). 5 Where b2m−1 = 2 (2m − 1)π , and b2m = 2 2mπ [ 1 − cos ( 2mπ 2 )] = 1 mπ [1 − cos (mπ)] ⇒ b2m = 1 mπ [1 − (−1)m] . We can further simplify: b2m = {0, m even 2/mπ, m odd So again, consider odd and even indices separately, ∞∑ m=1 b2m sin(2mx) = ∞∑ p=1 b2(2p) sin(2(2p)x)+ ∞∑ p=1 b2(2p−1) sin(2(2p−1)x) = ∞∑ p=1 b4p sin(4px)+ ∞∑ p=1 b4p−2 sin((4p−2)x), where b4p = 0 and b4p−2 = 2/(2p − 1)π. All together now, not writing in the zero terms, f (x) = ∞∑ m=1 b2m−1 sin((2m − 1)x) + ∞∑ p=1 b4p−2 sin((4p − 2)x) f (x) = 2 π ∞∑ m=1 1 2m − 1 sin((2m − 1)x) + 2 π ∞∑ p=1 1 2p − 1 sin(2(2p − 1)x). This is su˚cient. For the purposes of aesthetics only, let's change all the indices back to n f (x) = 2 π ∞∑ n=1 1 2n − 1 sin((2n − 1)x) + 2 π ∞∑ n=1 1 2n − 1 sin(2(2n − 1)x) and collect like terms, to obtain: f (x) = 2 π ∞∑ n=1 1 2n − 1 (sin((2n − 1)x) + sin(2(2n − 1)x)) . Finally we are asked to sketch the graph of the function to which the series converges - the odd periodic extension of f (x). See Fig.4. −3pi −2pi −pi 0 pi 2pi 3pi −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 x Figure 4: Three periods of the function the Fourier sine series of f (x) converges to (aka the odd periodic extension of f (x)). 6","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
