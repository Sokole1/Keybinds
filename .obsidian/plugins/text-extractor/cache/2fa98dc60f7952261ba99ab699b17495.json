What are they? (b) Consider the fixed-point iteration 241 = g(zy) for this g. For which of the points you have found in (a) can you be sure that the iterations will converge to that fixed point? Briefly justify your answer. You may assume that the initial guess is suffi- ciently close to the fixed point. (c) For the point or points you found in (b), roughly how many iterations will be required to reduce the error by a factor of 10?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
