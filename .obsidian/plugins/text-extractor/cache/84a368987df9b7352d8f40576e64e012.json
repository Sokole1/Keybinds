Median. 2. Scatterplot. 3. Cross-validation. 4. KNN. 5. Density-based clustering. 6. Polynomial basis. 7. Ll-regularization. 8. Softmax probability. 9. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). 10. PageRank. Match each one of the above items to one of the key properties below: 1. Assigning a score to a node in a graph. 2. Choosing regularization parameter. 3. Feature selection. 4. Finding non-convex clusters. 5. Multi-class loss function. 6. Non-linear regression. 7. Non-parametric classifier. 8. Non-parametric visualization. 9. Robust alternative to mean. 10. Visualizing dependency between 2 variables.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
