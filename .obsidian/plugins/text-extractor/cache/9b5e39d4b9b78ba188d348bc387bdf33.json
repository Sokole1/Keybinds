We can derive the gradeint in matrix notation as follows: 1. Convert to summation notation: . f(w) =Y ajw;, = where a; is element j of a and w; is element j of w. 2. Take the partial derivative with respect to a generic element k: o [ — Y aju;| =ap. 3. Assemble the partial derivatives into a vector: a5 [ | a Viw) =\" =, 2 ag 4. Convert to matrix notation: a, a Viw)=|\"|=a o So our final results is that Vf(w)=a. ‘This generalizes the scalar case where 4 [aw] = a. We can also consider general linear functions of the form f(w)=a\"w+8, for a scalar 5. But in this case we still have Vf(w) = a since the y-intercept 3 does not depend on w. 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
