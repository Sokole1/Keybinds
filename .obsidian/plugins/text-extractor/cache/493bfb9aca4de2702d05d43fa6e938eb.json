(b) (I − P ) 2 = I − 2P + P 2 = I − 2P + P = I − P . Question 8.2 This was shown in the lecture. Question 8.6 This is the notorious Jordan block (non-diagonalizable matrix) that we mentioned in the lecture as something we want to shy away from. If λ = λ1 = λ2 then ( λ 1 0 λ )k = (λ k kλk−1 0 λ k ) . The standard basis vector e1 = (1, 0)T is the lone eigenvector. So, we take a vector x = (x1 x2 ) = x1e1 + x2e2, where e1 and e2 are the standard basis vectors, and see that (λ 1 0 λ )k (x1 x2 ) = λk (x1 x2 ) + kλk−1 ( x2 0 ) . Thus, the error may decay very slowly. If additional eigenvalues were to be present, we would not get the same contraction factor that we get when there are no Jordan blocks of this form. (This is a slightly advanced question and there is no need to worry too much about understanding precisely how to conclude the convergence speed.) Question 8.17 Since A, B, C, D are all diagonal, a simple permutation P M P T with P a permutation matrix asso- ciated with the vector p = (1, k + 1, 2, k + 2, ...) T is a block diagonal matrix with 2 × 2 and 1 × 1 blocks (1 × 1 blocks will appear if matrix sizes are diﬀerent). An eﬃcient QR algorithm may then be applied to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of P M P T , which are the same as the eigenvalues of M . Most of the questions for which solutions are not provided are either programming questions or questions that are not part of the material and/or are more advanced than what you are expected to know. 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
