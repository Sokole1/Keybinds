Let P be a shortest path from a source node s to a target node ¢ of G. 1. Suppose that we increase all the edge weights by 1. Must P still be a shortest path from s to t? O Yes O No 2. Suppose that we multiply all the edge weights by 10. Must P still be a shortest path from s to ¢? O Yes O No 3. Suppose that all edges of G happen to have exactly the same weight. Will breadth first search (ignoring weights) starting from node s find the shortest path to ¢? O Yes O No","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
