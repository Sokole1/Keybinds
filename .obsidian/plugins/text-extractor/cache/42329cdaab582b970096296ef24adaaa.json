Aranking of the elements of S is consistent with T if for every triple (a, b, ¢) of T b lies between a and cin the ranking. That is, eithera < b < corc < b < ain the ranking. For example, if n = 5 and T = (s3,81,52), (81, 85, 52), (52, 83, 84) then the ranking R=32<31<83<55<34 is a consistent ranking, while R’=S3<31<52<S5<S4 is not consistent. An instance of the Consistent Ranking (CR) problem is the set T' of triples. The problem is to determine whether or not there is a ranking of the elements of S that is consistent with 7. Q7.1 Consistent Rankings 1 Point Check each the following rankings that is consistent with the set 7\" above.
