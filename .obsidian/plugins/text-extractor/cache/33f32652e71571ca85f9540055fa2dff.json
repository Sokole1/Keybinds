[3 marks| Recall (once again) the definition of the Dominating Set problem: Given a graph G = (V,E) and an integer k, we want to find a subset W of V such that [W| < k, and every elements of V — W is joined by an edge to an element of W. One of your friends came up with the following algorithm to find a dominating set of a graph G that is as small as possible: While V is not empty Let v be the element of V with the highest degree Add v to W Delete v and all of its neighbours from V Your friend asks you to prove the correctness of this algorithm using the “greedy algorithm stays ahead” approach. What is the first statement that you will need to prove?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
