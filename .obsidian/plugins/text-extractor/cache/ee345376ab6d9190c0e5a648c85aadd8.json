Federal Foreign Tax Credits General information This credit is for foreign income or profits taxes you paid on income sourced from a country other than Canada and reported on your Canadian return. Tax treaties with other countries may affect whether you are eligible for this credit. Notes You may have deducted an amount on line 25600 of your return for income that is not taxable in Canada under a tax treaty. In this case, do not include that income in your \"Net foreign non-business income\" (line 43300) or in your \"Net foreign business income\" (line 43900). Also, do not include any foreign tax paid on it in your \"Non-business income tax paid to a foreign country\" (line 43100) or in your \"Business income tax paid to a foreign country\" (line 43400). Where a foreign pension income qualifies as pension income eligible for income splitting under the federal Income Tax Act (the Act) and the pensioner (transferring spouse) and the receiving spouse have jointly elected to split such foreign pension income, any related foreign taxes paid may also be split on the same basis. The total of the split foreign taxes claimed by the pensioner and the receiving spouse cannot be more than the pensioner's total foreign taxes paid in relation to the split foreign pension income. For more information about splitting pension income, see Form T1032, Joint Election to Split Pension Income for 2023. If you paid tax to more than one foreign country, and the total foreign taxes paid to all foreign countries was more than $200, do the applicable calculation shown on this form for non-business and business taxes paid to each country on a separate sheet in Canadian dollars. Enter the total amount on this form. In most cases, the foreign tax credit you can claim for each foreign country is whichever of the following two amounts is lower: • the foreign income tax you actually paid • the tax otherwise payable in Canada on your net income from that country Note If you paid tax on income from property sourced outside of Canada (other than real or immovable property), your non-business foreign tax credit for that income cannot be more than 15% of your net income from that property. However, you may be able to deduct on line 23200 of your return the part of the foreign taxes you paid over 15%. The Canada Revenue Agency considers your contribution to a foreign public pension plan as a non-business income tax for foreign tax credit purposes when the following two conditions apply: • You are required to make the contribution under the legislation of the foreign country Note Contributions made under the United States (U.S.) Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), including Social Security and Medicare taxes, qualify for this credit. • It is reasonable to conclude that you will not be eligible for any financial benefit from your contribution considering that the employment in the foreign country was temporary and for a short period of time How to claim this credit • Do all of your calculations in Canadian dollars • If you were a member of a partnership and are entitled to claim a part of the foreign taxes the partnership paid, include in your calculations the amount shown in the financial statements or in box 171 and box 172 of your T5013 slip, Statement of Partnership Income • Claim the amount from line 12 of this form on line 40500 of your return. The amount on line 12 should not be more than the amount on line 42900 of your return Your federal foreign tax credit on non-business income may be less than the tax you paid to a foreign country. If this is the case, and you were not a resident of Quebec on December 31, 2023, you may be able to claim a provincial or territorial foreign tax credit. To help you calculate the credit, get Form T2036, Provincial or Territorial Foreign Tax Credit. Attach a completed copy of the form to your paper return. If you were a resident of Quebec on December 31, 2023, see Revenue Quebec's Guide to the Income Tax Return. T2209 E (23) (Ce formulaire est disponible en français.) Page 1 of 5 Also, on line 23200 of your return, you may be able to deduct the amount of net foreign taxes you paid for which you have not received a federal, provincial or territorial foreign tax credit. This does not include certain taxes you paid, such as those on amounts you could have deducted under a tax treaty on line 25600 of your return. For more information, see Income Tax Folio S5-F2-C1, Foreign Tax Credit. Note You may have earned foreign income in your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). If this is the case, do not include this income in your \"Net foreign non-business income\" (line 43300). Also, do not include any foreign tax paid on it in your \"Non-business income tax paid to a foreign country\" (line 43100). Supporting documents If you are filing electronically, keep all your documents in case the CRA asks to see them later. If you are filing a paper return, include your documents, such as a notice of assessment or other similar document from the foreign tax authority, showing foreign taxes you paid, and a note showing your calculations. You must also include this form. If you paid taxes to the U.S., attach your Form W-2, U.S. 1040 return, U.S. Account Transcript, and any other supporting documents that apply. If any of your documents are in a foreign language, the CRA needs a copy of the original documents written in the foreign language with an acceptable English or French translation. To be acceptable, the translation has to include the signatory's name, printed in the Latin alphabet, and has to meet one of the following conditions: • It is certified by an official with the authority to administer an oath or solemn declaration (commissioner of oaths, notary public, or lawyer) unless it was done by a translator who is a member in good standing of one of the provincial or territorial organizations of translators and interpreters of Canada • It has the seal and signature of an official from the foreign country's embassy, high commission, or consulate confirming it is a true translation • It has the signature of a Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) confirming it is a true translation • It includes a written statement indicating the profession and the signature of a teacher, professor or a religious leader confirming it is a true translation Note For the translation to be acceptable, your name cannot be the same as the signatory's.

Non-business income tax paid to a foreign country does not include tax that can reasonably be attributed to an amount that: • any other person or partnership has received, or is entitled to receive from the foreign country • relates to taxable capital gains from that country, and you or your spouse or common-law partner claimed a capital gains deduction for that income • was deductible as income exempt from tax under a tax treaty between Canada and that country • was taxable in the foreign country because you were a citizen of that country, and relates to income from a source within Canada Note The CRA considers any amount of tax you paid to a foreign government in excess of the amount you had to pay according to a tax treaty as a voluntary contribution and does not qualify as foreign taxes paid. (2) Net foreign non-business income Net amount you calculate when the non-business income you earned in a foreign country is more than the non-business losses you incurred in that country. When you calculate the non-business income and losses, claim the allowable expenses and deductions relating to the foreign income or loss.

If your net foreign non-business income is more than your net income, use your net income in the calculation. For more information on deductions claimed under subsections 20(11) and 20(12) of the Act, see Income Tax Folio S5-F2-C1, Foreign Tax Credit.

It does not include any part of the business income tax that can be reasonably attributed to an amount that any other person or partnership has received or is entitled to receive from a country, or that was payable on income that was exempt from tax under a tax treaty between Canada and that country. Note The CRA considers any amount of tax you paid to a foreign government in excess of the amount you had to pay according to a tax treaty as a voluntary contribution and does not qualify as foreign taxes paid. (6) Unused business foreign tax credits Unused business foreign tax credits can be carried forward 10 years and carried back 3 years. (7) Net foreign business income Net amount by which the business income you earned in a foreign country is more than the business losses you incurred in that country. When you calculate the business income and losses, claim the allowable expenses and deductions relating to the foreign income or loss, including foreign resource and exploration and development expenses. Also reduce your foreign business income by any income from that country that was, under a tax treaty between Canada and that country, exempt from tax in Canada or in that country. If your net foreign business income is more than your net income, use your net income in the calculation. Note Include only the foreign business income for the part of the year you were a resident of Canada.

This form does not apply to residents of Quebec. If you are a resident of Manitoba and you must pay minimum tax, you cannot claim a provincial foreign tax credit. Before you complete this form, calculate your federal foreign tax credit by using Form T2209, Federal Foreign Tax Credits.

As a result, you do not have to complete this form.

If you paid tax to more than one jurisdiction in 2023, calculate this amount according to note (3) of Form T2209. However, instead of \"line 23600 of your return plus the amount on line 68360 of Form T1206\" as stated in that note, use the amount allocated to your province or territory of residence in column 4, Part 1 of Form T2203 to do the calculation. (3) Provincial or territorial tax otherwise payable If you were a resident of a province or territory other than Ontario, Alberta, or British Columbia, enter the amount of tax calculated before determining the provincial or territorial foreign tax credit by using the appropriate Form 428 or, if you have to pay tax to more than one jurisdiction, complete the applicable part of Section 428MJ of Form T2203 for the province or territory in which you resided at the end of the tax year. If you were a resident of Ontario, calculate this amount by entering \"0\" on lines 70 and 72 of Form ON428 and continue the calculation. The result from line 81 is your provincial or territorial tax otherwise payable. If you paid tax to more than one jurisdiction in 2023, calculate this amount by entering \"0\" on lines 43 and 45 in Part 4 of Section ON428MJ of Form T2203 and continue the calculation. The amount from line 58 is your provincial or territorial tax otherwise payable. If you were a resident of Alberta, calculate your provincial or territorial tax otherwise payable by adding the amount from line 56 to the amount on line 61 of Form AB428 or by adding the amount from line 13 to the amount from line 32 in Part 4 of Section AB428MJ of Form T2203. If you were a resident of British Columbia at the end of the tax year, your provincial or territorial tax otherwise payable is the amount of tax calculated before determining the provincial and territorial foreign tax credit minus any British Columbia additional tax for minimum tax purposes from Form BC428 or Section BC428MJ of Form T2203.
