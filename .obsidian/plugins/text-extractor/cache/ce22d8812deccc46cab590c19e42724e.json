Use the Taylor expansions of u to ﬁnd the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations for the derivatives in this equation and ﬁnd a discrete form of the advection-diﬀusion equation. 2. Explain how you would advance the solution in time to ﬁnd u(x, t + ∆t) at each time step and discuss the order of accuracy of your numerical scheme in time and in space.
