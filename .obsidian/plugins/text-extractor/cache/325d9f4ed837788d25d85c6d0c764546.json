A set of locations needs water delivered and there’s another set of intermediate points through which we can deliver water. Some of these points can be connected—at varying costs—by laying new pipe, others cannot. You’d like to figure out the cheapest way to connect every delivery location to water. We can model the problem as a graph, by representing locations and intermediate points as nodes. Possible connections are represented as weighted edges, where the weight of an edge is the cost of laying pipe between its two endpoints. For simplicity, moving forward, we’ll assume that all costs are 1. 1. Build intuition through examples. Here’s an instance, where shaded nodes are in S. Indicate a solution to this problem, that is, a way to connect up all of the shaded nodes. Draw your own small examples. What are trivial instances?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
