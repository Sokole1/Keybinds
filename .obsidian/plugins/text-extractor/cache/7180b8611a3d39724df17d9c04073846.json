Please check the submission day/time on Canvas. §2.1, §2.4, §2.5 1. (The method of reduction of order). The following equation (1 − t2) d2y dt2 + 2t dy dt − 2y = 0, (1) has a solution y1(t) = t. If we assume y2(t) = y1(t)v(t) is another solution, we ﬁnd that v(t) satisﬁes tv′′ + ( 2 + 2t2 1 − t2 ) v′ = 0. Hence w = v′ satisﬁes w′ + ( 2 t + 2t 1 − t2 ) w = 0. (a) Solve w and v. You may assume w > 0 and t > 0 for simplicity. Update: You may assume w > 0 and 0 < t < 1 for simplicity. (b) Solve (1) with the initial conditions y(0) = 3 and y′(0) = −4. 2. 2.4.2: Consider a mass and spring system with a mass m = 2, spring constant k = 3, and damping constant c = 1. a) Set up and ﬁnd the general solution of the system. b) Is the system underdamped, overdamped or critically damped? c) If the system is not critically damped, ﬁnd a c that makes the system critically damped. 3. 2.4.6: Suppose you wish to measure the friction a mass of 0.1 kg experiences as it slides along a ﬂoor (you wish to ﬁnd c). You have a spring with spring constant k = 5 N/m. You take the spring, you attach it to the mass and ﬁx it to a wall. Then you pull on the spring and let the mass go. You ﬁnd that the mass oscillates with frequency 1 Hz. What is the friction? 4. 2.4.101: A mass of 2 kilograms is on a spring with spring constant k newtons per meter with no damping. Suppose the system is at rest and at time t = 0 the mass is kicked and starts traveling at 2 meters per second. How large does k have to be to so that the mass does not go further than 3 meters from the rest position? 5. 2.5.2: Find a particular solution of y′′ − y′ − 6y = e2x. 6. 2.5.3: Find a particular solution of y′′ − 4y′ + 4y = e2x. 7. Let k be a real constant. Find a particular solution to y′′ + 4y = sin kt. (Hint: You should consider two cases k = 2 or k ̸= 2.) 8. Let k be a real constant. Find the form of a particular solution to Ly = y′′ +4y′ +5y = e−kt sin t. You do not need to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients. (Hint: You should consider two cases k = 2 or k ̸= 2.) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
