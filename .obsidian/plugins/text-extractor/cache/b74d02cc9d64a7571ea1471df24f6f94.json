The number of meat orders by time ¢ is a Poisson process (Mz):>o with rate . The number of vegetarian orders is a Poisson process (Vi)io with rate v. These two Poisson processes are assumed to be independent. It is a theorem that the sum of two independent Poisson processes with rates y and v is itself a Poisson process whose rate is 1 + .

(b) Given that n orders are received by time f, find and identify the conditional distribution of the number of meat orders that have arrived by time .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
