Use zg = 0.5 and z; = 2.0 as your two initial guesses. Your program should use only one hyperbolic function evaluation per iteration; marks will be deducted for an inefficient implementation that is wasteful in terms of function evaluations. Print out the iterates and the absolute function values until the absolute value of the function, i.e., |f(zx)|, goes below 1010,","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
