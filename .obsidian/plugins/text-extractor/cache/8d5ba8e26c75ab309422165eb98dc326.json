(g) The curvature never achieves a minimum. (h) ˆııı = u 2 , ˆ = v− √3 w 4 , ˆk = √3 v+w 4 , r(t) = t u + t 2 v u v x y y = x 2 C 1 The curve (a(t), b(t) ) = (t, t 2) is the curve y = x2. It is “curviest” at the origin, which is consistent with part (f). It becomes ﬂatter and ﬂatter as |t| increases, but never achieves “perfect ﬂatness”, which is consistent with (g). 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
