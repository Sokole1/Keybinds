An instance I of the problem is a set {z1,z2,...,2,} of nonnegative integers and a positive integer m. We say that a value v, with 0 < v < m —1, is feasible with respect to instance I if for some non-empty subset R of {z1,z2,...,2n}, Z z=v (modm). z€R Also, for each 4,0 < ¢ < n, let V(i) be the set of feasible values with respect to instance ({z1, 2, ..., z;},m). 1.
