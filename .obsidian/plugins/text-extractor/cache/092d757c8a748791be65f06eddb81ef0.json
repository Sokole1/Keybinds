Furthermore, suppose we are given two matrices L and U such that L is unit lower triangular, U is upper triangular, and TA=LU. â€˜Write an algorithm that will solve the problem Ax=b for any given vector b in O(n?) complexity. First explain briefly yet clearly why your algorithm requires only O(n?) flops. Then specify your algorithm in detail (including the details for lower and upper triangular systems) using pseudocode or a MATLAB script.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
