A random number of people enter an elevator on the ground floor, with the distribution of the number being Poisson(A). There are N floors above the ground floor and each person is equally likely to get off at any one of the NV floors. Assume that the elevator does not make stops to pick up passengers until all who entered on the ground floor have gotten off. Show that the expected number of stops that the elevator will make before all passengers get off is N (1 — e~ */V). Hint: the indicator random variable I;, which is 1 if the elevator stops at floor ¢ and otherwise is 0, may be useful. Condition on the initial number of passengers.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
