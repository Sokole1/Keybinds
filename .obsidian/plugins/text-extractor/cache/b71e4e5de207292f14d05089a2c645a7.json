(a) Suppose bisection is applied on an IEEE double precision floating point system, starting from an initial interval [a,b], where a < 0 and b > 1. i. Explain briefly why this initial interval is a valid choice for the bisection algorithm. [1 mark] ii. Suppose the specific choice [a,b] = [~1,2] is made for the initial interval. To which of the two points will bisection con- verge? A. it will converge to z*™ =0 B. it will converge to z*® =1 C. it will converge randomly to one of z*® =0 or z*? =1, depending on roundoff errors D. none of the above answers is correct, Justify your answer briefly.
