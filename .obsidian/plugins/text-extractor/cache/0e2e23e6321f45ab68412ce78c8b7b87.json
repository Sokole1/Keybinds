Assume that: « filenames cannot contain nul characters ('\\' or equivalently ) » filenames are not necessarily nul-terminated * any padding bytes in the record are set to zero * adirectory block contains 4096 bytes For the storage scheme using this dirent structure to work and align properly, d_reclen must be exactly equal to the ceiling of (4 + 4 + d_namlen) / 4. By scanning the bytes in the name itself, we can determine the name length and so derive d_namlen. Alignment is a good reason to make the inode number the first field and d_reclen the second rather than the other way around. If d_reclen were not included in the structure, then given d_namlen and knowing the C structure padding rules, we can derive d_reclen.
