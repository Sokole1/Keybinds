Here, consider a reduction from problem A to problem B, as illustrated in the figure of part 9. 1. SCENARIO #1 (how we’ve used reductions prior to this worksheet): Say our reduction’s two algorithms take O(f(n)) time and the black box solver for B also takes O(f(n)) time. What can we say about the running time to solve problem A?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
