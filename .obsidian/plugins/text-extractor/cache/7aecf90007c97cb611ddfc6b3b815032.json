Here we’ll consider a slightly simplified reduction, from L4-SAT (a SAT variant where all clauses have four or fewer literals) to 3-SAT. For clauses with 1 or 2 literals, we convert to 3-SAT clauses by repeating the last literal. We leave 3-literal clauses as they are. To convert 4-literal clauses, we put the first three literals in one clause, and repeat the fourth literal three times in a second clause. This converts a clause of the form (Ty V z2 V 23 V @4) to two clauses (HVZ2V13)/\\(Z4\\/Z4VI4), This reduction is incorrect. Complete the following to supply a counterexample to its correctness: Counterexample instance (of L4-SAT): Correct solution to this instance (YES or NO plus a VERY brief explanation): Reduction’s solution to this instance (YES or NO plus a VERY brief explanation):","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
