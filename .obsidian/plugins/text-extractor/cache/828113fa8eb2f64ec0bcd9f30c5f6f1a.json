(a)(5 pt) Find the explicit solution y(x) to the following initial-value problem (IVP): y0 + xy2 + xy =0 ,y(2) = 1 . Solution: This is a separable equation that we rewrite y0 y2 + y = \u0000x. Then we do a partial fraction decomposition on the left: 1 y2 + y = 1 y(y + 1) = 1 y \u0000 1 y +1 . This gives ✓ 1 y \u0000 1 y +1 ◆ dy = \u0000xdx. Now we anti-di↵erentiate: ln |y| \u0000 ln |y +1| = \u0000 x2 2 + C ) y y +1 = ±e\u0000 x2 2 +C. To satisfy the IC, we need to pick up the positive branch of the solution such that: 1 1+ 1 = ±e\u00002+C ) C =2 + ln 1 2 Back-substitution leads to y y +1 = e\u0000 x2 2 +2+ln 1 2 = 1 2 e\u0000 x2 \u00004 2 . To recover the solution explicitly is a matter of algebra. The result is y(x)= e\u0000 x2 \u00004 2 2 \u0000 e\u0000 x2 \u00004 2 . (b)(5 pt) Find the explicit solution y(x) to the following IVP: y0 \u0000 tan(x)y =3x +1 ,x 2 ⇣\u0000 ⇡ 2 , ⇡ 2 ⌘ ,y(0) = 1 . Solution: We ﬁrst calculate the integration factor: r(x)= eR \u0000 tan(x)dx = eR \u0000 sin(x) cos(x) dx = eln | cos(x)| = eln(cos(x)) = cos(x), because cos(x) > 0 for x 2 ⇣\u0000 ⇡ 2 , ⇡ 2 ⌘.Multiplying the ODE by r(x) leads to d dx (cos(x)y) = cos(x)y0 \u0000 sin(x)y =(3x + 1) cos(x). Therefore cos(x)y(x)= Z (3x + 1) cos(x) dx. We use integration by parts (U =3x + 1, dV = cos(x) dx; dU =3 dx, V =sin(x)) to get Z cos(x)(3x + 1)dx =(3x + 1) sin(x) + 3 cos(x)+ C. Therefore y(x)= 1 cos(x) ((3x + 1) sin(x) + 3 cos(x)+ C) =(3x + 1) tan(x)+3+ C cos(x) We apply the IC: y(0) = 1 = 3 + C gives C = \u00002. Finally, y(x)=(3x + 1) tan(x) \u0000 2 cos(x) +3. 2. Consider this initial-value problem involving an unspeciﬁed initial velocity k: y00 \u0000 y0 \u0000 2y = 120e\u0000t; y(0) = 215,y0(0) = k. (a)(8 pt) Solve the given IVP for y(t). Your answer may involve k. (b)(2 pt) Find the k for which lim t!1 y(t) = 0. Write down the corresponding function y(t). Solution: (a) The linear operator L[y]= y00 \u0000 y0 \u0000 2y has characteristic polynomial p(r)= r2 \u0000 r \u0000 2= (r \u0000 2)(r + 1). The roots contribute exponential-style solutions to the homogeneous equation L[y] = 0. The general solution for L[y]=0 is yc(t)= c1e2t + c2e\u0000t,c1,c2 2 R. To ﬁnd a particular solution, recognize the exponential rate r = \u00001 of the in- put function as a simple zero of the characteristic polynomial. This calls for an upgraded postulate of the form yp = Ate\u0000t. To determine the constant A, we ﬁrst calculate yp = Ate\u0000t,y0 p = A(1 \u0000 t)e\u0000t.y00 p = A(t \u0000 2)e\u0000t. Thus yp will satisfy the given ODE if and only if 120e\u0000t = L[yp]= A [(t \u0000 2) \u0000 (1 \u0000 t) \u0000 2t] e\u0000t, i.e., 120 = \u00003A, so A = \u000040. The general solution for the full ODE is y(t)= yc(t)+ yp(t)= c1e2t + c2e\u0000t \u0000 40te\u0000t,c1,c2 2 R. The given initial conditions dictate the speciﬁc constants to select above: 215 = y(0) = c1 + c2,k = y0(0) = 2c1 \u0000 c2 \u0000 40. We ﬁnd c2 = 215 \u0000 c1,so c1 =(k + 255)/3. Report: y(t)= ✓ k + 255 3 ◆ e2t \u0000 ✓215 \u0000 k + 255 3 ◆ e\u0000t \u0000 40te\u0000t. (b) To kill exponential growth requires k = \u0000255. In this case y(t)= \u0000215e\u0000t \u0000 40te\u0000t. 3. Consider the following IVP: (Axy +3y2)+(x2 + Bxy)y0 =0,y(2) = \u00001. Find implicit-form solutions for two di↵erent pairs of constants A, B, as follows. (a)(4 pt) Choose A, B to make the given ODE exact. Solve the IVP for these values of A, B. Solution: Recognize M (x, y)= Axy+3y2 and N (x, y)= x2+Bxy. The exactness test is @M @y = @N @x , i.e., Ax +6y =2x + By. This calls for A = 2 and B = 6. With these values, solving for F in @F @x = M (x, y)=2xy +3y2, @F @y = N (x, y)=6xy + x2 leads to F (x, y)= x2y +3xy2 + C. Applying the given IC leads to x2y +3xy2 =2. (b)(6 pt) Given B = 2, choose A so that the given ODE becomes exact when multiplied by a nonconstant integrating factor µ = µ(x) independent of y. Solve the IVP for these values of A, B. Solution: With B = 2 and µ = µ(x), the exactness test is µ(x) @M @y = @ @x (µ(x)N ) , i.e., (Ax +6y)µ =(2x +2y)µ +(x2 +2xy)µ0. Rearrangement gives µ0(x) µ(x) = (A \u0000 2)x +4y x(x +2y) . To make the right side independent of y requires A = 4, which leads to µ0/µ =2/x or µ(x)= x2. Multiplying the given ODE by µ(x) gives 4x3y +3x2y2 +(x4 +2x3y)y0 =0. This is exact by construction, so we look for F = F (x, y) such that @F @x =4x3y +3x2y2, @F @y = x4 +2x3y. The usual methods lead to the general form F (x, y)= x4y + x3y2 + C.This F must be constant along the solution we seek. Applying the IC gives the result: x4y + x3y2 = \u00008. 4. The following ODE could represent a mass-spring-damper system subjected to an external sinusoidal force of frequency ! > 0: y00 + 1 5 y0 + y = M cos(!t). (a)(4 pt) Find the general solution for the ODE in the unforced case, where M = 0. Solution: Here p(r)= r2 + 1 5 r + 1 has roots r = \u0000(1/5) ± p (1/5)2 \u0000 4 2 = \u0000 1 10 ± 1 2 r \u0000 99 25 = \u0000 1 10 ± i 3 p11 10 . The general solution of the homogeneous equation is y(t)= e\u0000t/10 c1 cos 3 p11 10 ! + c2 sin 3p11 10 !! ,c1,c2 2 R. (b)(8 pt) Find a particular solution for the ODE, valid for any M> 0 and ! > 0. [Continue your work on the next page, if you need more space.] Solution: Guess yp = A cos(!t)+ B sin(!t). Calculate yp = A cos(!t)+B sin(!t) y0 p = !B cos(!t) \u0000!A sin(!t) y00 p = \u0000!2A cos(!t) \u0000!2B sin(!t) The ODE requires M cos(!t)= y00 p + 1 5 y0 p + yp = ✓(1 \u0000 !2)A + !B 5 ◆ cos(!t)+ ✓(1 \u0000 !2)B \u0000 !A 5 ◆ sin(!t). The coe\u0000cient of sin(!t) on the left is 0. Matching the one on the right gives 0=(1 \u0000 !2)B \u0000 !A 5 , so A = 5(1 \u0000 !2) ! B. Matching the coe\u0000cients of cos(!t) and using the above, we have M =(1 \u0000 !2)A + !B 5 = 5(1 \u0000 !2)2 ! B + !B 5 = 25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2 5! B. This gives B = 5! 25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2 M, so A = 25(1 \u0000 !2) 25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2 M. The particular solution is yp = A cos(!t)+ B sin(!t), with the constants given above. (c)(5 pt) Let C denote the amplitude of the steady oscillations observed for large t> 0. Find a formula for C, valid for any M> 0, ! > 0. Discuss the limiting case ! ⇡ 0. Solution: For the solution in part (b), the amplitude C obeys C = pA2 + B2 = \" 252(1 \u0000 !2)2 + 25!2 [25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2]2 M 2#1/2 . Noticing the common factor of 25 in the numerator simpliﬁes this expression C =5M \" 25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2 [25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2]2 #1/2 = 5M [25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2]1/2 . In the special case where ! = 0, the forcing input is the constant M and a particular solution for the original ODE is obviously that same constant. Our calculations above give A = M and B = 0, so C = M . This is consistent, which is encouraging. (d)(3 pt) In lightly-damped situations, the steady response amplitude described above can be much larger than the input amplitude. Find an interval of !-values for which C> 5M . Hint: Introduce x = !2 and study a suitable quadratic function of x. Solution: One has C> 5M for all ! > 0 such that p25(1 \u0000 !2)2 + !2 < 1. To decode this, square both sides and substitute x = !2: 25(1 \u0000 x)2 + x< 1 , (25x2 \u0000 50x + 25) + x \u0000 1 < 0 , 25x2 \u0000 49x + 24 < 0. The quadratic on the left factors as (25x \u0000 24)(x \u0000 1). Its roots are also revealed by the quadratic formula: x = 49 ± p (49)2 \u0000 4(24)(25) 2(25) = 49 ± p2401 \u0000 2400 50 = 49 ± 1 50 . The quadratic opens upward, so its negative values occur between the roots. Thus the desired inequality holds when 24 25 <x < 1, and the requested interval of angular frequencies is p24 5 < ! < 1. 5. (a)(5 pt) Find the function f (t) and sketch its graph on the axes provided, given L {f (t)} = F (s)= 18 s2 ✓e\u0000⇡s \u0000 e\u00002⇡s◆ . Solution: t y = f (t) 18⇡ ⇡ 2⇡ This is a case for Shift Theorem #2. Let G(s)= 1 s2 ,so g(t)= t and f (t) = 18L \u00001\u0000e\u0000⇡sG(s) \u0000 18L \u00001\u0000e\u00002⇡sG(s) = 18u(t \u0000 ⇡)g(t \u0000 ⇡) \u0000 18u(t \u0000 2⇡)g(t \u0000 2⇡) = 18u(t \u0000 ⇡)[t \u0000 ⇡] \u0000 18u(t \u0000 2⇡)[t \u0000 2⇡]. Now for all t \u0000 2⇡, both unit-step functions equal 1 and we have f (t) = 18 ✓t \u0000 ⇡ \u0000 [t \u0000 2⇡]◆ = 18⇡, t \u0000 2⇡. Thus we have a piecewise-linear function that is easy to sketch: f (t)= 8 >>>< >>>: 0, for t< ⇡, 18(t \u0000 ⇡), for ⇡  t< 2⇡, 18⇡, for 2⇡  t. (In fact a version of this “ramp-loading” function was discussed in class.) (b)(10 pt) Using the function f (t) from part (a), consider the following IVP: y00 +9y = f (t),y(0) = 0,y0(0) = 0. Show that y(t)= k + C cos(!t \u0000 \u0000) on some interval of the form (R, +1). Identify the constants k, C, !, \u0000, and R in this statement. To resolve ambiguity, choose C> 0, ! > 0, \u0000 2 [0, 2⇡), and R as small as possible. Solution: Take the Laplace Transform in the given equation, noting that F (s)is given in part (a) and using the simple initial conditions: s2Y (s)+9Y (s)= F (s)= 18 s2 \u0000e\u0000⇡s \u0000 e\u00002⇡s\u0000 Y (s)= e\u0000⇡sH(s) \u0000 e\u00002⇡sH(s), for H(s)= 18 s2(s2 + 9) . Classic partial fractions (which could be simpliﬁed by substituting s2 = z) give H(s)= a s + b s2 + cs s2 +9 + d s2 +9 . This entails h(t)= a + bt + c cos(3t)+(d/3) sin(3t), with the constants from 18 = as(s2 + 9) + b(s2 + 9) + cs3 + ds2. Matching coe\u0000cients of s gives a = 0; matching coe\u0000cients of s3 gives a + c = 0, so c = 0. Looking at s2 gives b + d = 0, and choosing s = 0 gives b = 2. Therefore d = \u00002 and H(s)= 2 s2 \u0000 2 s2 +9 =) h(t)=2 ✓t \u0000 1 3 sin(3t)◆ . As in part (a), we apply Shift Theorem #2: y(t)= L \u00001\u0000e\u0000⇡sH(s) \u0000 L \u00001\u0000e\u00002⇡sH(s) = u(t \u0000 ⇡)h(t \u0000 ⇡) \u0000 u(t \u0000 2⇡)h(t \u0000 2⇡) For t \u0000 2⇡, both unit step functions equal 1 so y(t)= h(t \u0000 ⇡) \u0000 h(t \u0000 2⇡) =2 ✓t \u0000 ⇡ \u0000 1 3 sin(3[t \u0000 ⇡])◆ \u0000 2 ✓t \u0000 2⇡ \u0000 1 3 sin(3[t \u0000 2⇡])◆ =2⇡ + 4 3 sin(3t). To get the last line we used sin(3[t \u0000 ⇡]) = \u0000 sin(3t) and sin(3[t \u0000 2⇡]) = sin(3t). Further, sin(3t) = cos(3t \u0000 \u0000) for \u0000 = ⇡/2. Thus we have y(t)= 2⇡ + 4 3 cos⇣3t \u0000 ⇡ 2 ⌘ for t> 2⇡. The desired equation holds with k =2⇡, C = 4 3 , ! = 3, \u0000 = ⇡ 2 , R =2⇡. 6. Consider the following non-homogeneous initial-value problem for the functions x(t),y(t): x0 = \u00004x \u0000 3y +2 ,x(0) = 2 , (1) y0 =6x +5y \u0000 2et ,y(0) = 2 .

Solution: The homogenous system is ✓ x0 y0 ◆ =  \u00004 \u00003 65 \u0000✓ x y ◆ . Let P denote the 2 ⇥ 2 matrix on the right.

Thus the eigenvalues are \u00001 = \u00001 and \u00002 = 2. We now calculate the corresponding eigenvectors.

Match, respectively, the constants and the coe\u0000cients of et to ﬁnd both P a = \u00002i,P b \u0000 b =2j. Now det(P )= \u00002 and det(P \u0000 I)= \u00002, so the standard inversion formula gives a = \u00002P \u00001i = \u00002 \u00002  53 \u00006 \u00004 \u00001 0 \u0000 =  5 \u00006 \u0000 , b = 2(P \u0000 I)\u00001j = 2 \u00002  43 \u00006 \u00005 \u00000 1 \u0000 = \u00003 5 \u0000 .

We have \u00001 < 0 < \u00002,the CP (\u00001, 1) is a saddle point and is unstable.
