State (but don’t prove) conditions under which Newton’s method converges quadratically.

Consider the function f(z) = 252% — 10z + 1. How fast should we expect convergence of Newton’s method to be? Justify your answer. How well would the bisection method work for this function?","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
