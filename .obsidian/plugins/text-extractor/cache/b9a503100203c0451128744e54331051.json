Classify the points −∞ < x < ∞ as ordinary points, regular singular points and irregular singular points. 2. Use the appropriate series expansion about the point x = 0 to determine two independent solutions to equation (1). You only need to determine the ﬁrst three non-zero terms in each case. 3. What can you say about the minimum radius of convergence of the series solution you found in 2.? Question 2 Solve the following BVP ut(x, t) = uxx(x, t) + π2e −24π2t sin(5πx), 0 < x < 1, t > 0 u(0, t) = 0, u(1, t) = 0, t > 0 u(x, 0) = 3 sin(4πx), 0 < x < 1.
