Personally, I am quite expressive in my body language when I speak, but others are not. I see huge potential in understanding the intricacies in communication through nonverbal means. Especially with online communication, virtual reality, and augmented reality, the experience can be greatly improved if we are able to capture and communicate these nuances digitally. I have gained quite a bit of experience with research from my time in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. This developed my skills for researching various ideas, experiment design, data collection, evaluation, and writing a well-structured report. With my understanding of Computer Science and Math, I believe I have the fundamental knowledge to conduct thorough research and analysis for the Honda Research Institute. Python is my strongest language, and it is also the language we are using in my machine learning course to implement various machine learning techniques from the ground up. I also have experience with Pytorch and Tensorflow. I am grateful to have the opportunity to provide my best work possible in Japan. It would be an honour to be a part of frontier research with HRI. Please contact the Canada-Japan Co-op office at 604-822-6579 or coop.japan@ubc.ca to arrange an interview. Thank you for your time and consideration.
