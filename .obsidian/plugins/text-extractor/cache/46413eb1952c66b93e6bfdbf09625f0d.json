As the circle rolls, it dispenses the thread along the ground. When the circle rolls radians, it dispenses the arc length fa of thread and the circle advances a distance fa. So the centre of the circle has moved fa units to the right from its starting point, z = a. The centre of the circle always has y-coordinate a. So, after rolling 8 radians, the centre of the circle is at position Â¢(f) = (a + ab, a). (b) Now, let's consider the position of P on the circle, after the circle has rolled @ radians. ____asing NP From the diagram, we see that P is a cos 8 units above the centre of the circle, and a sin @ units to the right of it. So, the position of P is (a+ab + asinb,a + acosb). Remark: this type of curve is known as a cycloid.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
