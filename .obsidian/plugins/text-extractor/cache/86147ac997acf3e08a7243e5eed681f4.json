First, we define the similarity between two categories C; and C3 to be the maximum similarity between any pair of photos p1, p2 such that p; € C; and ps € Cs. Then, the cost of a categorization is the maximum similarity between any two of its categories. The lower the cost, the better the categorization, since we we don’t want categories to be similar. So, we want to find a solution with minimum cost. We’ll use the term “optimal solution” (rather than “good solution”) to refer to solutions that have minimum cost. ‘Write down optimal solutions and their costs for your previous examples.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
