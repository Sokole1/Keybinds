We promote pioneering and innovative research in information and communication-related fields with global collaboration among industry, academia and government. Outstanding research outcomes have been steadily achieved in such fields as computational neuroscience, deep human- robot interaction, wireless and communications, and life science. ATR is also taking initiatives to build and develop a global innovation ecosystem in the Keihanna Science City, and is working to commercialize research outcomes. [Computational Neuroscience Laboratories] We aim to understand brain functions through computational modelling, and develop Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) leading to improved Al and clinical applications, such as for the recovery of motor and cognitive functions in humans. https://bicr.atr.jp/en/ Canada-Japan Co-op Student job description/responsibilities Co-Op Student -How Humans & Machines Learn From Errors Efficient learning and strategic decision-making critically depend on the ability to discern when to consider bad/good outcomes and when to ignore them. Often, outcome can arise from concurrent and hidden causes. How do we know what caused what? In this project we will study the neural and computational mechanisms that enable strategic learning from past choices and outcomes. We will address two overarching questions: 1) How do humans allocate credits to diverse sources of errors? 2) What neuro-computational mechanisms do they use to do this? Uncovering the computational principles that people use to learn from mistakes will advance current theories of human cognition and inform future developments in machine intelligence. Depending on the student's interest, the project can involve statistical and machine learning techniques applied to fMRI and/or ECoG datasets, computational modeling of behavior, and/or artificial neural network simulations.
