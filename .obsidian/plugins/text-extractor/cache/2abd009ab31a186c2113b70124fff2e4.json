The mass is attached to a dashpot mechanism that has a damping constant of 0.25 lbs/ft and is acted on by an external force of 4cos(2t) Ib. (a) Determine the steady-state response of this system. (b) If the given mass is replaced by a mass m, determine the value of m for which the amplitude of the steady-state response is maximum.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
