Note that this means there are d total parameters for the model’s covariances (plus kd parameters in each class’s separate mean, ). Hint: You might be able to significantly simply notation if you write something like Zwm:m or define some shortcut notation like Zweyc to mean the same thing; just make sure it’s clear. You also might want to use n, = Zzeyc 1 to be the number of cases where y(d = c. Hint: The determinant of a diagonal matriz is the product of its diagonal entries. The inverse is the diagonal matriz where each diagonal entry is inverted. B T B Answer: Let f(uc,Xc) = Zle Diy=c (10g|2c\\ + (2@ — pe) Bt (z® — I—lc)) . ; Ta_ . . 2 In summation form: (z“) - [_LC) ;!
