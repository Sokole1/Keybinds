Using y(2) = 0, we get 0 = −2 + c, thus c = 2. Thus y = −1 + et−t2+2 Marking. 1pt for rewriting, 2pt for integration, 2pt for constant c, 1pt for ﬁnal answer. No penalty for not checking sign of ln.

We have M = x2y3 + x y ; N = x3y2 + axp y2 + sin y My = 3x2y2 − x y2 , Nx = 3x 2y2 + apxp−1 y2 Equating My = Nx we must have p − 1 = 1, ap = −1 so that p = 2, a = − 1 2 so that the solution is ϕ(x, y) = C where ϕx = x2y3 + x y , ϕy = x3y2 − 1 2 x2 y2 + sin y. Then ϕ = ∫ ϕxdx = 1 3 x3y3 + 1 2 x2 y + F (y); ϕy = x3y2 − 1 2 x2 y2 + F ′(y) = x3y2 − 1 2 x2 y2 + sin y F ′(y) = sin y F (y) = − cos y so that the solution is ϕ = C : 1 3 x 3y3 + 1 2 x2 y − cos y = C.

(a)(6 points) Find the solution to the initial value problem x′′ − 4x′ + 13x = 0, x(0) = 1, x ′(0) = 1. Answer. Characteristic equation is r2 − 4r + 13 = 0 which has roots r = 2 ± 3i so that the general solution is x = e2t (A cos (3t) + B sin(3t)) . Initial conditions yield A = 1, 2A + 3B = 1 so that B = −1/3, hence x = e2t (cos (3t) − 1 3 sin(3t) ) . Marking. 3pts for general soln, 3pts for correct ﬁnal answer.

It has spring constant k, mass m, and there is a friction force −cx′ that acts on it. Then x(t) is modelled by the ODE mx′′ + cx ′ + kx = 0. (a) Suppose the friction is negligible (c ≈ 0) and the spring constant is k = 1. It is known that the spring is oscillating with frequency of 0.5 hertz (i.e. 0.5 full periods per second). Determine the mass m of the spring. Answer. For c = 0, the solution is of the form x = A sin (ωt + Φ) where ω = √ k/m = √ 1/m. Half hertz means that ω = 0.5 ∗ 2π. so that 1/m = π2, or m = 1/π2 Marking. 2 points for omega, 2 points for m. (b) More careful measurements show that the friction is non zero. In fact the maximum value of x(t) decreases slowly with each pe- riod. Every t = 20 seconds this maximum value is decreased by half as illustrated on the right. Estimate c.

Decay rate means that e− c 2m 20 = 1 2 so that c = 2m 20 ln 2 = ln 2 10π2 . (c ≈ 0.0070) Marking. 2 points for correct amplitude formula (i.e. e−ct/2/m) and 2 pts for right answer. December 2015 Math 215/255 Sections 101–104 Final Exam Page 6 of 14 5. (a)(6 points) Find the inverse Laplace transform of the function F (s) = s (s + 2)[(s + 2)2 + 1] . Answer. Notice that F (s) = 1 s + 2 · s + 2 − 2 (s + 2)2 + 1 . By the ﬁrst shifting property, we have L −1[F (s)](t) = e −2tL −1 [ s − 2 s(s2 + 1) ] (t). By the partial fraction, we know that s − 2 s(s2 + 1) = A s + Bs + C s2 + 1 . So we get s − 2 = A(s2 + 1) + s(Bs + C) = (A + B)s 2 + Cs + A. So we have A + B = 0, C = 1, A = −2. Then A = −2, B = 2 and C = 1. Hence s − 2 s(s2 + 1) = − 2 s + 2s + 1 s2 + 1 = − 2 s + 2s s2 + 1 + 1 s2 + 1 . So L −1[F (s)](t) = e −2t [−2 + 2 cos(t) + sin(t)] . Marking. 1pt for the ﬁrst shifting property, 3pt for partial fraction, 2pt for the answer. December 2015 Math 215/255 Sections 101–104 Final Exam Page 7 of 14 (b)(6 points) Find the Laplace transform of the function f (t) =    t, if 0 ≤ t < 2, 2 if 2 ≤ t < 3, 1, if t ≥ 3. Answer. It’s easy to see that f (t) = t[u(t − 0) − u(t − 2)] + 2[u(t − 2) − u(t − 3)] + 1[u(t − 3) − u(t − ∞)] = t − tu(t − 2) + 2u(t − 2) − 2u(t − 3) + u(t − 3) = t − (t − 2)u(t − 2) − u(t − 3). By the second shifting property, we have L[f (t)](s) = L[t] − L[(t − 2)u(t − 2)] − L[u(t − 3)] = 1 s2 − e−2sL[t](s) − e−3s s = 1 s2 − e−2s s2 − e−3s s . Marking. 3pt for f (t), 3 pt for answer December 2015 Math 215/255 Sections 101–104 Final Exam Page 8 of 14 6.(8 points) Use the Laplace transform to solve the following initial value problem: y′′ + 6y′ + 10y = δ(t − 2), y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 1. Answer. Let Y (s) = L[y(t)](s), apply the Laplace transform on the both sides of y′′ + 6y′ + 10y = δ(t − 2), then L[y′′] + 6L[y′] + 10L[y] = L[δ(t − 2)]. By the transform of derivatives, since y(0) = 1 and y′(0) = 1, then L[y′′] = s 2L[y] − sy(0) − y′(0) = s 2Y (s) − s − 1, and L[y′] = sL[y] − y(0) = sY (s) − 1. By looking up the table, we know that L[δ(t − 2)] = e−2s. So we get s 2Y (s) − s − 1 + 6sY (s) − 6 + 10Y (s) = e −2s. So we get Y (s) = s + 7 + e−2s s2 + 6s + 10 = s + 7 s2 + 6s + 10 + e−2s s2 + 6s + 10 . Notice that s2 + 6s + 10 = (s + 3)2 + 1, by the ﬁrst and second shifting properties, we have y(t) = L −1[Y (s)](t) = L −1 [ s + 3 + 4 (s + 3)2 + 1 ] (t) + L −1 [ e−2s (s + 3)2 + 1 ] (t) = e −3tL−1 [ s + 4 s2 + 1 ] (t) + u(t − 2)L−1 [ 1 (s + 3)2 + 1 ] (t − 2) = e −3t [L −1 [ s s2 + 1 ] (t) + L −1 [ 4 s2 + 1 ] (t)] + u(t − 2)e −3(t−2) sin(t − 2) = e −3t[cos(t) + 4 sin(t)] + u(t − 2)e −3(t−2) sin(t − 2). Marking. 3pt for Y (s), 1 pt for completing square, 2pt for the ﬁrst inverse, 2 pt for the second inverse December 2015 Math 215/255 Sections 101–104 Final Exam Page 9 of 14 7.(8 points) Find the general solution to the homogeneous linear system ⃗x′ = [ 1 −2 1 3 ] ⃗x. Answer. Let’s ﬁnd eigenvalues of [ 1 −2 1 3 ], then we solve det [ 1 − λ −2 1 3 − λ ] = (1 − λ)(3 − λ) + 2 = λ 2 − 4λ + 5 = 0. So we get λ1 = 2 + i, λ2 = 2 − i. For λ1 = 2 + i, let’s ﬁnd the corresponding eigenvector, that is, [ 1 −2 1 3 ] [ x1 x2 ] = λ1 [ x1 x2 ] = (2 + i) [ x1 x2 ] . So we get [ −1 − i −2 1 1 − i ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . So we get x1 + (1 − i)x2 = 0, that is, x1 = (i − 1)x2. So we take [ i − 1 1 ] be one corresponding eigenvector for λ1 = 2 + i. Hence e (2+i)t [ i − 1 1 ] is a solution to the system ⃗x′ = [ 1 −2 1 3 ] ⃗x. Notice that e(2+i)t [ i − 1 1 ] = [ (i − 1)e(2+i)t e(2+i)t ] = [ (i − 1)e2t[cos(t) + i sin(t)] e2t[cos(t) + i sin(t)] ] = [ ie2t cos(t) − e2t sin(t) − e2t cos(t) − ie2t sin(t) e2t cos(t) + ie2t sin(t) ] = [ −e2t sin(t) − e2t cos(t) e2t cos(t) ] + i [ e2t cos(t) − e2t sin(t) e2t sin(t) ] . So the general solution to the homogeneous linear system ⃗x′ = [ 1 −2 1 3 ] ⃗x is: ⃗xc(t) = C1 [ −e2t sin(t) − e2t cos(t) e2t cos(t) ] + C2 [ e2t cos(t) − e2t sin(t) e2t sin(t) ] . Marking. 4pt for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, 3pt for ﬁnding real and imaginary pats, 1 pt for the answer December 2015 Math 215/255 Sections 101–104 Final Exam Page 10 of 14 8.(7 points) Describe the behaviour of the homogeneous linear system { x′ = 3x − 2y y′ = 2x − 2y , and sketch the phase portrait. Identify the eigenvectors on the phase portrait. Answer. Let A = [ 3 −2 2 −2 ], ﬁrst let’s ﬁnd eigenvalues of A, then we need to solve det(A − λI2) = det [ 3 − λ −2 2 −2 − λ ] = (3 − λ)(−2 − λ) + 4 = λ 2 − λ − 2 = 0 So A has eigenvalues: λ1 = 2 > 0, λ2 = −1 < 0. So the equilibrium point (0, 0) is a saddle point(unstable). • For λ1 = 2, let’s ﬁnd one corresponding eigenvector, that is, we need to solve A⃗x = λ1⃗x = 2⃗x, then [ 1 −2 2 −4 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] So we have x1 − 2x2 = 0, that is, x1 = 2x2 and [ x1 x2 ] = [ 2x2 x2 ] = x2 [ 2 1 ] . So [ 2 1 ] is one eigenvector for λ1 = 2. • For λ2 = −1, let’s ﬁnd one corresponding eigenvector, that is, we need to solve A⃗x = λ1⃗x = 2⃗x, then [ 4 −2 2 −1 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] So we have 4x1 − 2x2 = 0, that is, x2 = 2x1 and [ x1 x2 ] = [ x1 2x2 ] = x1 [ 1 2 ]. So [ 1 2 ] is one eigenvector for λ2 = −1. Therefore, the phase portrait of the system looks like: Marking. 4pt for ﬁnding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, 1pt for saddle point, 2 pt for the graph December 2015 Math 215/255 Sections 101–104 Final Exam Page 11 of 14 9.(8 points) Let A = [ 2 1 −1 2 ] . It is known that x1 = [ e2t cos t −e2t sin t ] and x2 = [ e2t sin t e2t cos t ] are two solutions to the system x′ = Ax. Use this information to solve the following initial value problem: x′ = Ax +   0 e2t cos t   , x(0) = [ 0 0 ] . Hint: ∫ sin t cos t dt = − log(cos t), ∫ cos t sin t dt = log(sin t). Answer. The fundamental matrix is X(t) = [ e2t cos t e2t sin t −e2t sin t e2t cos t ] . Its inverse is given by [X(t)] −1 = [ e−2t cos t −e−2t sin t e−2t sin t e−2t cos t ] . The formula for solution is then x(t) = X(t) [X(0)] −1 x(0) + X(t) ∫ t 0 [X(s)] −1 [ 0 e2s cos s ] ds = X(t) ∫ t 0 [X(s)] −1 [ 0 e2s cos s ] ds. (1) The integral simpliﬁes to ∫ t 0 [X(s)] −1 [ 0 e2t cos t ] ds = ∫ t 0 [ − sin s cos s 1 ] ds = [ log cos t t ] so that (1) becomes x(t) = [ e2t cos t e2t sin t −e2t sin t e2t cos t ] [ log cos t t ] = e2t [ (log cos t) cos t + t sin t −(log cos t) sin t + t cos t ] .
