Assume that each of the following strings, ending with a parity check bit, was received correctly except for a missing bit indicated with a question mark. What is the missing bit? a) 1?11111 b)?0101010100 c) 1010?01 (3pts) 2. Using the check digit scheme described in class x7 = 7x1 + 3x2 + x3 + 7x4 + 3x5 + x6 mod 10, check whether the following passport numbers are valid, or determine the check digit to be added to obtain a valid passport number. a) 805237? b) 132999? c) 4501824 (3 pts) 3. As explained in the class, the check digit for the ISBN-10 code is a 10 digit number. The ﬁrst nine digits are decimal digits and the check digit x10 is a base 11 digit, so the symbol X is used if x10 = 10. The check digit is selected so that the congruence 10∑ i=1 ixi ≡ 0 mod 11. Show that the check digit x10 in an ISBN-10 code x1x2 · · · x10 can be computed from the congruence x10 ≡ ∑9 i=1 ixi mod 11. (3pts) 4. Using Fermat’s Little Theorem, ﬁnd the least positive residue of 21,000,000 modulo 17. (3pts) 5. Find an integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by either 2 or 5, but that is divisible by 3. What can you say about all the integers that satisfy this property? (5 pts) 6. Find the least positive residue of 8 · 9 · 10 · 11 · 12 · 13 modulo 7. (3 pts) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
