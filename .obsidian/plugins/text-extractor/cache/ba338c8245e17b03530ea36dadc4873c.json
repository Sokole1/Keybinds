However, if a node v fails, then no messages can be sent along links incident on v. If failure of v could cause two other nodes of the network to become disconnected, we call v a vulnerability. Indicate whether the following statements are true or false. 1. Suppose that for some node i, the breadth first search tree rooted at Â¢ has just one internal node at some level >0>0. Then the network must contain a vulnerability. O True O False 2. Suppose that the diameter of the network (as defined in the worksheet on graphs) is greater than n/2n/2. Then the network must contain a vulnerability. O True O False 3. Suppose that the radius of the network is greater than n/4n/4. Then the network must contain a vulnerability.
