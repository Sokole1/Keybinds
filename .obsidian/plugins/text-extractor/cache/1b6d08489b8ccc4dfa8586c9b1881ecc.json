Find the velocity, speed and acceleration at time t of the particle whose position is ⃗r (t) = a cos t ̂ııı + a sin t ̂ + ct ̂k . Describe the path of the particle. 2.

Here θ is the angle between both vectors emanating from the origin. Compute cos θ and determine whether θ < π/2, θ = π/2, or θ > π/2. (c) Sketch the position vector ⃗r(t) and the tangent vector ⃗r′(t) at t = 3π/4. In this sketch, ⃗r(t) is emanating from the origin and ⃗r′(t) starts from the tip of ⃗r(t). 4. Find the velocity and position vectors of a particle that has the given acceleration and the given initial velocity and position: ⃗a(t) = sin t̂ııı + 2 cos t̂ + 6t ̂k , ⃗v(0) = − ̂k , ⃗r(0) = ̂ − 4 ̂k . 5.
