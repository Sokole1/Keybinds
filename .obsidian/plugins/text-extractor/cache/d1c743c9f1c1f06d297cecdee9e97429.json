Suppose a and b are both relatively prime to the positive integer n. If (ordn a, ordn b) = 1, show that ordn(ab) = ordn a · ordn b. Ans: Let α = ordn a, β = ordn b and γ = ordn(ab). Since (ab) αβ = a αβb αβ = (aα) β(b β)α ≡ 1β1α = 1 mod n, we conclude that γ divides αβ. Conversely, by deﬁnition of order, 1 (ab) γ = aγb γ mod n. This gives 1 = 1 α ≡ [a γb γ] α = aγαb γα ≡ b γα mod n, since γα is a multiple of the order α of a. This allows us to conclude that γα is divisible by β, hence the hypothesis α, β) = 1 gives that β | γ. By symmetry, we also have α | γ, hence αβ | γ, since α and β are relatively prime. 2. Let n be a positive integer and a an integer relatively prime to n. If ordn a = n − 1, show that n is prime. Ans: If ordn a = n − 1, then (n − 1) | ϕ(n). In particular, (n − 1) ≤ ϕ(n). On the other hand, the deﬁnition of the Euler phi function yields n − 1 ≥ ϕ(n), hence ϕ(n) = (n − 1). This implies that p is prime. In fact, let d be a divisor of n with 1 ≤ d < n. Since d divides n, we have d = (d, n) = 1 where the last equality holds because ϕ(n) = (n − 1). Hence the only positive divisors of n are itself and 1, so n is prime. 3. a) Show that the integer 20 has no primitive roots. 1 Ans: If a is relatively prime to 20 then it is relatively prime to 5 and 4. Since ϕ(5) = 4, by Euler’s Theorem, we have a 4 ≡ 1 mod 5. Similarly, as ϕ(4) = 2, Euler’s Theorem gives a 2 ≡ 1 mod 4. Since the gcd(4, 5) = 1, the above congruences combined with the Chinese Remainder Theorem implies that a4 ≡ 1 mod 20. In particular, ord20 4 ≤ 4. Since ϕ(20) = ϕ(5)ϕ(4) = 8, it follows that 20 has no primitive roots. b) Find a primitive root modulo 14 and 18. Ans: As 36 ≡ 1 mod 7, 3 is a primitive root of 7. Since 3 is odd and 14 = 2 · 7, it follows that 3 is a primitive root of 14. Note that 2 is a primitive root of 9, since ϕ(9) = 6 and 26 ≡ 1 mod 9. But 2 is not a primitive root of 18 as 2 is not relatively prime to 18. As 11 6 ≡ 26 ≡ 1 mod 18, we see that 11 is a primitive root of 18. c) Find a complete set of incongruent primitive roots of 17. Ans: Note that ϕ(17) = 16. If a is reduced modulo 17, then ord17 a ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. By calculations, one checks that ord17 2 = 8. As the order of a power of the base divides the order of the base, no power of 2 can be a primitive root of 17. The set (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256) is a complete set of incongruent power of 2 modulo 17. Hence none of 2, 4, 8, 16, 15, 13, 9, 1 is a primitive root of 17. Modulo 17, the primitive roots must lie among 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14. On the other hand, we have ϕ(16) = ϕ(24) = 8 and there are 8 incongruent primitive roots of 17. Hence these eight integers above form a complete list of primitive roots of 17. 2 4. Show that if ¯a is an inverse of a modulo n, then ordn a = ordn ¯a. Ans: Suppose at ≡ 1 mod n. Then a t ≡ 1 mod n ≡ (¯ata t)(at) ≡ (a¯a)ta t ≡ 1t.1 ≡ 1 mod n. Hence ¯at ≡ 1 mod n. By symmetry, we see that at ≡ 1 mod n if and only if ¯at ≡ 1 mod n. Hence ordn a = ordn ¯a. 5. Decide whether it is true that if n is a positive integer and d is a divisor of ϕ(n), then there is an integer a with ordn a = d. Give reasons for your answer. Ans: This is false. Let n = 8, so that ϕ(n) = ϕ(8) = 4. As (a, 8) = 1, this implies that a is odd. Since a2 ≡ 1 mod 8 whenever a is odd, the order of an integer modulo 8 is no more than 2 and hence cannot equal 4. 6. Let m = an − 1, where a and n are positive integers. Show that ordm a = n, and conclude that n | ϕ(m). Ans: We have at < m = an −1 whenever 1 ≤ t < n. Hence at cannot be congruent to 1 modulo m when t is a ositive integer less than n. However, an ≡ 1 mod m because m = (an − 1) | (an − 1). Therefore ordm a = n. As ordm a mod ϕ(m), we conclude that n | ϕ(m). 3","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
