We call a node v of G a connector if its removal (along with its incident edges) would make the remaining graph disconnected. 1. (2 points) Which, if any, nodes are connectors in the following graph? Select all that apply. Oa @b Oc @4 Oe Of O g Ohn 2. (2 points) Suppose that a depth first search tree T of G happens to be rooted at a node s, where s is not a connector. Explain why s can only have one child in 7. Suppose s has at least two children sy, sg, ..., 8, in T'. Without loss of generality, suppose s is the first child reached by DFS. By the properties of DFS, G does not contain a path from s; to S, ..., S, since if there were a path in G, so, ..., s, would be a descendent of s; instead of a child of 7. Therefore if s is removed, all of sy, s9, ..., s, Wwill be disconnected from each other. This means if s has more than 1 child, it is a connector. So for s to not be a connector, it cannot have more than one child in 7. Since n > 2 and s is the root node, s cannot have 0 children, so s has exactly 1 child in 7. 3. (2 points) Suppose that a depth first search tree T' of G happens to be rooted at a node s, where the degree of s is tree T\" is 1. Might s be a connector of the graph? Justify your answer. No, a degree of 1 means it only has 1 edge to its child s;. All nodes in G are descendents of s1 by the properties of DFS and since G is connected. So if s is removed, it does not disconnect the graph since all remaining nodes are still connected through s;. 4. (3 points) Let v be an internal node of DFS tree T' of G. Show that v is a connector if and only if for some child vâ€™ of v, there is no dashed edge from a node in the subtree rooted at v/ to an ancestor of v. Here, an ancestor of v is any node w that is on the path from the root of the tree to v, other than v itself.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
