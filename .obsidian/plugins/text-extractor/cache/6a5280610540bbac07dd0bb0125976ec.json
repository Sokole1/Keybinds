The rate of change of the volume of a snowball that is melting is proportional to the surface area of the snowball. Suppose the snowball is perfectly spherical. The volume (in centimeters cubed) of a ball of radius r centimeters is (*/3)7r>. The surface area is 47r2. Set up the differential equation for how the radius r is changing. Then, suppose that at timet = 0 minutes, the radius is 10 centimeters. After 5 minutes, the radius is 8 centimeters. At what time ¢ will the snowball be completely melted? > Answer, Exercise 1.1.18.
