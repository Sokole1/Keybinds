That is, determine what ag and a; for this approximation to be valid for a small (in magnitude) value of . (b) Write a short MATLAB script that computes f(z) for z = 0.01,z = 0.001 and z = 0.0001, in single precision and in double precision. The default of MATLAB is double precision, and for single precision use the MATLAB command single. You should compute six values in total (three values for each of the two precisions). Explain the difference in the quality of the results between the two precisions, based on analyzing the error and the rounding units of the corresponding floating point systems. (c) Suggest a formula that is more suitable for numerical computation of the above quanti- ties, and explain why this formula is expected to be better. Repeat your calculations of the same six quantities with this formula to show that your new formula indeed produces either the same quality or more accurate results, depending on the value of z and the floating point system used. .","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
