Suppose that the curve C is the intersection of the cylinder 22 +y? = 1 with the surface z=a22—y% (a) Find a parameterization of C'. (b) Determine the curvature of C' at the point P = (1/v2,1/v/2,0). (c) Find the osculating plane to C at the point P. In general, the osculating plane to a curve ¥'(t) at the point T (fo) is the plane which fits the curve best at ¥ (ty). It passes through F (fy) and has normal vector B(t,). (d) Find the radius and the centre of the osculating circle to C' at the point P.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
