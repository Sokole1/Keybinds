Explain what the Internet is, and how (generally) it is put together B. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of packet vs circuit switching C. Define the term protocol in the context of a computer network D. List the layers of the Internet protocol stack, in their proper order, and what functions each layer performs E. Explain encapsulation and the structure of packets flowing in the Internet 3CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi The Internet 4CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi The Internet: “nuts and bolts” view 5 • Billions of connected computing devices: hosts, end-systems • PCs workstations, servers • smartphones, toasters, IoT • running network apps • communication links • fiber, copper, radio, satellite • varying bandwidth/latency • routers: forward packets (chunks of data) • regional, local, company networks local ISP company network regional ISP router workstation server mobile gateway CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Internet Goals • Main goal: integrating a number of separately administrated entities into a common entity • Secondary goals: • Must continue despite loss of the network or gateway • Must support multiple types of services (applications) • Must support multiple types of networks • Distributed management of resources • Cost effective • Easy host attachment • Resources must be accountable 6CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Communication Necessary conditions: • a communication medium: modulation of some medium (e.g., air) • source(s) and destination(s) • protocol: shared information (language) • message: information sent from source to destination on a medium using a protocol 7CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Large Scale “Communication” Systems • Telephone / Telegraph • Mail • Package delivery (Canada Post, DHL, Amazon) 8CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi An Analogy: Mail Delivery • What makes up a postal address? • What needs to be listed in the envelope? 9 Maryam R.Aliabadi 201-2366 Main Mall V6T1Z4, Vancouver, BC, CANADA CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Another Analogy: Phone Numbers 10 +1 604-822-2222 • What makes up a phone number? CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi How Does This Translate to the Internet? • What makes up an IP Address? 11 192.210.62.3 CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Question How do you think IP addresses are organized? Or in other words, how are A.x.y.z and A.u.v.w or (A.B.C.x and A.B.C.y) close together? [A,B,C: constants; u,v,w,x,y,z: variables] A. Geographically B. By organization (company, university, government, etc.) C. By Fully-Qualified Domain Name (thetis.cs.ubc.ca, www.amazon.com, etc.) D. There is no organization, it is essentially random 12CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi The Connection Medium is Shared 14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/statistical-multiplexing CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Multiplexing • Data flows need to be “multiplexed” • Multiple input streams must share the medium • It must be possible to “demultiplex” at the destination 15CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi How is Data Sent (option 1)? • Circuit switching • Dedicated path between source and destination • The path the data will take is determined when the connection is established • Single stream of information per path • Multiple multiplexing options • Time division multiplexing (time quotas) • Frequency division multiplexing (different frequencies) • Code division multiplexing (different representations of data) • Orthogonal multiplexing (combination of techniques) 16CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Circuit Switching • The more “obvious” option • Historically we needed a “wire” running from source phone to destination phone • Models how humans communicate (we talk to one person at a time) • Works well when • Guaranteed service is valuable (guarantee is provided assuming no un- anticipated or catastrophic failures happen) • Demand is steady (unchanging rate) • Starting a new conversation is rare 17CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi How is Data Sent (option 2)? • Packet switching • Data is divided in packets (small chunks of data) that are sent individually • Each packet is self-contained • Contains source and destination address as well as data • Independently routed from source to destination • Medium is occupied only during the transmission of the packet • Statistical multiplexing 18CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Statistical Multiplexing 19 https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/statistical-multiplexing CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Packet Switching • A much less “obvious” option • Initially, many people thought it wouldn’t work at all • Imagine if each word you speak had to be addressed to the person who you intend to hear it! • Works well when • Statistically good performance is good enough • Demand is bursty (rapidly changing rate) • Starting a new conversation is frequent • Overall, allows more conversations and better utilization of the medium 20CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Question Which of the following DOES NOT need to be included in a self- contained Internet packet? A. Its source address B. Its destination address C. The route it needs to take to get to the destination D. An indication of ordering (for data with multiple parts) E. All of the above need to be included 21CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Summary • The Internet is a network of networks • Its design goals include: reliability, flexibility, decentralized management, cost effectiveness, accountability • Circuit switching vs packet switching 23CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi In-class activity • Form yourselves into groups (1 – 9 students per group) • You should be able to chat conveniently in your group • Go to PrairieLearn • Click on Assessments • Start the ICA11 assessment (Circuit vs Packet Switching) • Talk in your group about the answers • Hearing other students ideas • Explaining your ideas to others 24CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Design of the Internet Maryam R.Aliabadi Next Topic: Switching Protocols 25","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
