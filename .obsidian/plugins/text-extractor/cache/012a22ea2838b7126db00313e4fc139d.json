Encrypt the message SURRENDER IMMEDIATELY using the aﬃne transformation C ≡ 11P + 18 mod 26. (3pts) 2. Decrypt the message YLFQX PCRIT, which was encrypted using the aﬃne trans- formation C ≡ 21P + 5 mod 26. (3pts) 3. Given two ciphers, the plaintext may be encrypted by ﬁrst using one of the ciphers, and then using the other cipher on this result. This procedure is called a product cipher. Find the product cipher obtained by using the transformation C ≡ 5P + 13 mod 26 followed by the transformation C ≡ 17P + 3 mod 26. (3pts) 4. Use the Vigen`erecipher with encrypting key SECRET to encrypt the message.(4pts) DO NOT OPEN THIS ENVELOPE 5. Decrypt the following message which was encrypted using the Vigen`ere cipher with the encrypting keyword SECRET. (4pts) WBRCS LAZGJ MGKMF V. 6. Suppose a plaintext message is encrypted using a Vigen`ere cipher. Show that identical strings of characters separated by a multiple of the key length are encrypted to the same string of ciphertext characters. (3pts) 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
