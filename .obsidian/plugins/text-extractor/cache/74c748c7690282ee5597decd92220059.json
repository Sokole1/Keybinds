Please check the submission day/time on Canvas. §1.7, §1.8, §2.1, §2.2 1 Written problems 1. Show that the equation (3x2y + 2xy + y3) + (x2 + y2)y′ = 0 is not exact, then solve it using an integrating factor. 2. Solve the IVP: { y′′ + 4y′ + 3y = 0 y(0) = 2, y′(0) = −1 3. Determine a second order equation veriﬁed by the general solution: y(x) = C1ex + C2e−2x; C1, C2 ∈ R 4. We consider the diﬀerential equation yy′′ + (y′)2 = 0 for t > 0. We know that y1(t) = t1/2 and y2(t) = 1 are solutions to this equation. (a) Show that y(t) = C1y1(t) + C2y2(t), with C1, C2 ∈ R, is not, in general, a solution to this equation. (b) Explain why the previous result doesn’t contradict the principle of superposition. 5. We consider the following IVP: { (x − 2)y′′ + y′ + (x − 2)tan(x)y = 0 y(3) = 0, y′(3) = 1 Without solving the IVP, determine the longest interval in which the IVP is certain to have a unique solution. 6. Write the given expressions in the form a + ib: (a) exp(5 − 8i) (b) 21−i 7. We consider the following IVP: { y′′ + 2y′ + 6y = 0 y(0) = 2, y′(0) = α ≥ 0 (a) Find the solution y(t) of the IVP. (b) Determine α such that y = 0 when t = 1. 1 8. We consider the following IVP: { y′′ − y′ + 1 4 y = 0 y(0) = 2, y′(0) = b (a) Find the solution of the IVP as a function of t and b. (b) Determine the critical value of b that separates solutions that remain positive for all t > 0 from those that eventually become negative. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
