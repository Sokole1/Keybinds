Consider the ellipse C on the xy-plane described by the equation ( x a )2 + (y b )2 = 1. (a) Parametrize C and set up the integral for the arclength of the curve. You are not required to evaluate the integral. (b) Find the unit tangent vector of the ellipse at the point ( a √ 2 , b √2 ) on the ellipse. (c) Find the curvature of the ellipse at the point ( a √2, b √2). (d) Find the radius of the osculating circle of the ellipse at the point ( a √2, b √2). 2. Suppose that the curve C is the intersection of the cylinder x2 + y2 = 1 with the surface z = x2 − y2. (a) Find a parameterization of C. (b) Determine the curvature of C at the point P = (1/ √2, 1/ √2, 0). (c) Find the osculating plane to C at the point P . In general, the osculating plane to a curve ⃗r (t) at the point ⃗r (t0) is the plane which ﬁts the curve best at ⃗r (t0). It passes through ⃗r (t0) and has normal vector ̂B(t0). (d) Find the radius and the centre of the osculating circle to C at the point P . 3. Consider a particle whose position at time t is given by ⃗r (t) = ⟨cos t, sin t, e t⟩. (a) Compute the velocity and acceleration. (b) Find the curvature κ(t) of the trajectory at the point ⃗r (t). (c) Find the tangential and the normal component of the acceleration. 4. Consider a particle whose position at time t > 0 is given by ⃗r (t) = ⟨t 2, 2t, log t⟩. Here we use log t for the inverse of the exponential function: log e t = t. (a) Compute the velocity and acceleration. (b) Find the curvature κ(t) of the trajectory at the point ⃗r (t). (c) Find the tangential and the normal component of the acceleration. 5. Find the unit tangent, unit normal and binormal vectors and the curvature and torsion of the curve ⃗r (t) = sin(3t) ̂ııı + cos(3t) ̂ + 4t ̂k . 6. Find the unit tangent, unit normal and binormal vectors and the curvature and torsion of the curve ⃗r (t) = t 2 ̂ııı + 2t ̂ + 1 3 t 3 ̂k . Page 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
