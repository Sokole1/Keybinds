(10 pts) Let ⃗r(t) = (sin t − t cos t)ˆi + (cos t + t sin t)ˆj + t 2 2 ˆk be a parametrized curve deﬁned for t ≥ 0. (a) Find the length of the curve ⃗r(t) from ⃗r(0) = (0, 1, 0) to ⃗r(π) = (π, −1, π2/2). (b) Find the curvature of the curve at time t = π. Solution. We compute v = (cos t − cos t + t sin t, − sin t + sin t + t cos t, t) = (t sin t, t cos t, t). The speed is |v| = √t2 sin 2 t + t2 cos2 t + t2 = √ 2t. Therefore the arclength is ∫ π 0 |v|dt = ∫ π 0 √ 2tdt = √ 2 \f \f \f \f π 0 t 2 2 = π2 √ 2 . For the curvature, we use κ = |v × a|/|v| 3. The acceleration is a = (sin t + t cos t, cos t − t sin t, 1). We compute v(π) × a(π) = \f \f \f \f   i j k 0 −π π −π −1 1   \f \f \f \f = (0, −π2, −π2) Therefore |v × a| = √2π2 and |v| = √2π, and κ(π) = 1 |v|3 |v × a| = 2 1/2π2 23/2π3 = 1 2π . 2. (10 pts) Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F given by ⃗F = x − 2y x2 + y2 ˆi + 2x + y x2 + y2 ˆj + (z2 + z) ˆk. (a) Determine the domain of ⃗F. (b) Compute ∇ × ⃗F. (c) Evaluate the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · dr where C is the circle of radius 1 in the plane z = 5, centered at (0, 0, 5) and traversed clockwise if viewed from the positive z-axis. (d) Is ⃗F conservative? Page 1 Math 317 Old Final Exam Solution. The domain is R 3\\{x = y = 0}. We compute A = ∂ ∂x 2x + y x2 + y2 = 2(x2 + y2) −1 − (2x + y)(x2 + y2) −2(2x) = 2x2 + 2y2 − 4x2 − 2xy (x2 + y2)2 . and B = ∂ ∂y x − 2y x2 + y2 = −2(x2 + y2) −1 − (x − 2y)(x2 + y2) −2(2y) = −2x2 − 2y2 − 2xy + 4y2 (x2 + y2)2 . From here, ∇ × F = \f \f \f \f   i j k ∂x ∂y ∂z x−2y x2+y2 2x+y x2+y2 z2 + z   \f \f \f \f = (0, 0, A − B) = (0, 0, 0). Next, parametrize C by r = (cos t, − sin t, 5), 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then F(r(t)) = (cos t + 2 sin t, 2 cos t − sin t, 30), and the line integral is ∫ 2π 0 (cos t + 2 sin t, 2 cos t − sin t, 30) · (− sin t, − cos t, 0)dt which becomes ∫ 2π 0 −(2 sin 2 t + 2 cos 2 t)dt = −(2)(2π) = −4π. It follows that F is not conservative, since the main theorem on conservative vector ﬁelds states that conservative vector ﬁelds satisfy ∫ C F · dr = 0 for all closed curves C. 3. (10 pts) (a) Let C be the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (1, 1) and (0, 1), oriented counterclock- wise. Compute the line integral ∫ C sin3(x2)dx + x2ydy. Page 2 Math 317 Old Final Exam (b) Use Green’s theorem to prove that if C is a simple closed curve in the plane, then the area A enclosed by C is given by A = 1 2 ∮ C xdy − ydx. Solution. For part (a), we compute 2DcurlF = [ ∂x ∂y sin 3 x2 x2y ] = 2xy. Let R be the region inside the triangle. By Green’s theorem, ∫ C F · dr = ∫ ∫ R 2xy dA. The straight line between the ﬁrst two points (0, 0) and (1, 1) has the equation y = x. The top line from (1, 1) to (0, 1) is just the equation y = 1. So the bounds of the integral are: ∫ x=1 x=0 ∫ y=1 y=x 2xy dydx. This evaluates to ∫ 1 0 (\f \f \f \f 1 xxy2) dx = ∫ 1 0 (x − x3)dx = \f \f \f \f 1 0 x2 2 − x4 4 and in total we have ∫ C F · dr = 1 4 . For part (b), we let F = (−y, x). By Green’s theorem, then 1 2 ∮ C xdy − ydx = 1 2 ∫ C F · dr = 1 2 ∫ ∫ R(2D curlF)dA. Since (2D curlF) = \f \f \f \f [ ∂x ∂y −y x ] \f \f \f \f = 2, then 1 2 ∮ C xdy − ydx = 1 2 ∫ ∫ R 2dA = A. 4. (10 pts) Let S be the part of the surface z = xy, where x2 + y2 ≤ 1, oriented upward. (a) Compute the surface area of S. (b) Compute ∫∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y, z) = (−y, z, 0). Page 3 Math 317 Old Final Exam Solution. For part (a), we write z = f (x, y) = xy and so dS = √ 1 + f 2 x + f 2 y dxdy = (1 + x2 + y2) 1/2dxdy. The area is ∫ ∫ S dS = ∫ ∫ {x2+y2≤1}(1 + x2 + y2) 1/2dxdy. Switching to polar coordinates, the integal becomes ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 1 0 (1 + r2) 1/2rdrdθ = 2π\f \f \f \f 1 0(1 + r2) 3/2 2 3 1 2 and so altogether we have ∫ ∫ S dS = 2π 3 (2 3/2 − 1). For part (b), we use n dS = (−fx, −fy, 1)dxdy = (−y, −x, 1)dxdy where the sign is chosen due to upward orientation. The integral becomes ∫ ∫ S F · n dS = ∫ ∫ (−y, z, 0) · (−y, −x, 1)dxdy = ∫ ∫ {x2+y2≤1}(y2 − x2y)dxdy, where we used z = xy. Switching to polar coordinates gives ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 1 0 (r2 sin 2 θ − r3 cos 2 θ sin θ)rdrdθ = ∫ 2π 0 \f \f \f \f 1 0 (r4 4 sin2 θ − r5 5 cos 2 θ sin θ) dθ = ∫ 2π 0 1 4 sin 2 θdθ − ∫ 2π 0 1 5 cos 2 θ sin θdθ = π 4 − 0 since we can directly use ∫ 2π 0 sin2 θdθ = π (common formula in this course) and ∫ 2π 0 1 5 cos 2 θ sin θdθ = 0 by the symmetry θ 7→ −θ which sends cos2 θ sin θ 7→ − cos 2 θ sin θ. Altogether, ∫ ∫ S F · n dS = π 4 . 5. (10 pts) Let S be the sphere given by x2 + y2 + z2 = 2 with outward orientation. Let ⃗F(x, y, z) = (e z + x, −y, z3). Page 4 Math 317 Old Final Exam (a) Compute the ﬂux integral ∫ ∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS. (b) Compute the ﬂux integral ∫ ∫ S(∇ × ⃗F) · ˆn dS. Solution. Let V be the solid region inside of S. The divergence is ∇ · F = 1 − 1 + 3z2 = 3z2. By the divergence theorem ∫ ∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V 3z2 dV. We switch to spherical coordinates so that z = ρ cos ϕ and dV = ρ2 sin ϕdρdϕdθ. The integral becomes ∫ 2π 0 ∫ π 0 ∫ √2 0 3(ρ cos ϕ) 2ρ2 sin ϕdρdϕdθ = (2π)(3) ∫ π 0 cos 2 ϕ sin ϕdϕ ∫ √2 0 ρ4dρ = (6π)(\f \f \f \f π 0 − cos 3 ϕ 3 )(\f \f \f \f √2 0 ρ 5 5 ) = π 5 2 9/2. Therefore ∫ ∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS = π 5 2 9/2. For part (b), we note that div curl = 0 so that ∫ ∫ S(∇ × ⃗F) · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V ∇ · (∇ × ⃗F)dV = 0. 6. (10 pts) Let C be the curve of intersection of the surfaces z = x2 +y2 and z = 2y+2x+5 oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above. Compute the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · dr for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = (−y + x2, x + y2, z2). Solution. We will use Stokes’ theorem, so we compute ∇ × F = (0, 0, 2). Page 5 Math 317 Old Final Exam The curve bounds the surface S given by z = f (x, y) = 2x + 2y + 5 and x2 + y2 ≤ z. By Stokes’ theorem ∫ C F · dr = ∫ ∫ S(∇ × F) · ndS = The normal is ndS = (−fx, −fy, 1)dxdy which becomes ndS = (−2 − 2, 1)dxdy Taking the dot product ∫ ∫ S(∇ × F) · ndS = ∫ ∫ S 2dxdy. The surface S is given by x2 + y2 ≤ 2x + 2y + 5 which after completing the square becomes (x − 1) 2 + (y − 1)2 ≤ 7 The area of this circle is 7π, so the ﬁnal answer is (2)(7π) = 14π. 7. (10 pts) Let a, b ∈ R be constants, and consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = (xz + y2, axeyz + byz, 2 − xeyz2). (a) Find the constants a, b such that ⃗F = ∇ × ⃗A for some vector ﬁeld ⃗A. (b) Let a, b be as in part (a) so that ⃗F admits a vector potential. Evaluate the ﬂux integral ∫ ∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS where the surface S is the hemisphere given by the equations x2 + y2 + z2 = 2, z ≥ 0 with upward normal. Solution. Since ⃗F is C 1 on R 3, we have that ⃗F admits a vector potential if and only if ∇ · F = 0. We compute ∇ · F = z + axe yz + bz − 2xeyz Setting this zero, we obtain a = 2 and b = −1. For (b), we use the technique of switch the surface. This can either be understood using Stokes’ theorem or the divergence theorem. Let’s use the Stokes’ theorem version, which says that if F admits a vector potential then it has the “surface independence property”. Page 6 Math 317 Old Final Exam Let S1 be the ﬂat disc at the bottom of the hemisphere: z = 0 and x2 + y2 ≤ 2. Then ndS = (0, 0, 1)dxdy. The integral is ∫ ∫ S F · ˆndS = ∫ ∫ x2+y2≤2(∗, ∗, 2 − 0) · (0, 0, 1)dxdy = 2 ∫ ∫ x2+y2≤2 dxdy. The ﬂux is then 4π. 8. (10 pts) Recall the notation ρ = ρ(x, y, z) = √ x2 + y2 + z2. (a) Compute the constants a, b such that ∇ 2ρ 1/2 = aρ−b. (b) Compute lim ε→0 ∫ ∫ ∂Bε(0)(∇2ρ1/2) dS or show that the limit does not exist. Here we are using the notation ∂Bε(0) = {(x, y, z) ∈ R 3 such that x2 + y2 + z2 = ε2} for the sphere of radius ε > 0 centred at the origin. Solution. We have ∇2ρ1/2 = ∇ · ∇ρ1/2 and in-class we used identities such as ∇ρ = ρ−1⃗r where ⃗r = (x, y, z). We start with ∇ρ 1/2 = 1 2ρ−1/2∇ρ = 1 2ρ−3/2⃗r. Next, ∇2ρ1/2 = ∇ · ∇ρ 1/2 = 1 2 [∇ρ−3/2 · ⃗r + ρ−3/2∇ · ⃗r ] = 1 2 [ − 3 2 ρ −5/2∇ρ · ⃗r + ρ−3/2(1 + 1 + 1) ] = 1 2 [ − 3 2 ρ −5/2ρ −1⃗r · ⃗r + 3ρ−3/2] = 1 2 [ − 3 2 ρ −5/2ρ −1ρ2 + 3ρ−3/2] = 3 4ρ−3/2 Therefore a = 3/4 and b = 3/2. For the integral, we compute ∫ ∫ ∂Bϵ(0)(∇ 2ρ 1/2)dS = ∫ ∫ ∂Bϵ(0) 3 4 ρ−3/2 dS = 3 4 ϵ −3/2 ∫ ∫ ∂Bϵ(0) dS = 3 4 ϵ −3/2(4πϵ 2) = 3πϵ 1/2. Page 7 Math 317 Old Final Exam Therefore lim ε→0 ∫ ∫ ∂Bε(0)(∇2ρ1/2) dS = 0. Page 8","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
