(a) Compute the arclength function s(t) from P = ⃗r(1) to ⃗r(t). Solution: The velocity is v = ( t √2 , t √2, t 2). The speed is |v| = (t 2 + t4) 1/2 = t(1 + t 2) 1/2. The arclength function is s(t) = ∫ t 1 u(1 + u 2) 1/2du = \f \f \f \f t 1(1 + u 2) 3/2(2/3)(1/2) which becomes s(t) = 1 3 (1 + t 2)3/2 − 2 3/2 3 (b) Reparametrize the curve with respect to arclength starting from P . Solution: We need to solve for t. The equation is 3s + 23/2 = (1 + t 2) 3/2. This implies (3s + 23/2)2/3 = 1 + t 2 and so t = ((3s + 23/2) 2/3 − 1) 1/2. Reparametrizing the curve then gives r(s) = ( 1 2 √2((3s + 23/2)2/3 − 1)) ˆi + ( 1 2 √ 2 ((3s + 23/2)2/3 − 1) ) ˆj + ( 1 3((3s + 23/2)2/3 − 1)3/2)ˆk for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 3(1 + 4)3/2 − 23/2 3 . Page 3 of 12 2. 10 marks Let ⃗F = (−2y cos x sin x)ˆi + (cos2 x + 2(yz + 1)eyz)ˆj + (2y2eyz + 1)ˆk. (a) Find a potential for this vector ﬁeld, i.e. solve ⃗F = ∇ϕ. Solution: First we solve ∂xϕ = −2y cos x sin x which gives ϕ = y cos 2 x + f (y, z). Next, we solve the z-equation ∂zϕ = 2y2eyz + 1 which gives ∂zf = 2y2e yz + 1 and so f (y, z) = 2ye yz + z + g(y) and ϕ = y cos 2 x + 2ye yz + z + g(y). Substituting into ∂yϕ = cos 2 x + 2(yz + 1)e yz gives g′ = 0, so potentials are of the form ϕ = y cos 2 x + 2ye yz + z + C. (b) Compute ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r where C is parametrized by ⃗r(t) = (cos t, sin t, cos 2 t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Solution: C is a closed loop, so the integral is zero. Page 4 of 12 3. 10 marks Let ∂Dr(⃗p) denote the circle of radius r centered at ⃗p ∈ R 2 oriented counter-clockwise. This means D100(0, 10) is a disc of radius 100 with center (0, 10). Let ⃗F = (F1, F2) be a C 1 vector ﬁeld on R2\\{(0, 0), (0, −10), (0, 10)}. In other words, ⃗F may not be deﬁned (e.g. due to division by zero) at the three points (0, 0), (0, −10) and (0, 10) which are stacked vertically in a line. Suppose furthermore that ∂1F2 = ∂2F1 wherever ⃗F is deﬁned. (a) Knowing that 1 = ∫ ∂D1(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r, 2 = ∫ ∂D12(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r, compute the line integral ∫ ∂D1(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r. Solution: Let R be the region inside the big disc D11(0, 10) but with the small discs D1(0, 0) and D1(0, 10) removed. Said otherwise, let R = D11(0, 10)\\{D1(0, 0) ∪ D1(0, 10)}. By Green’s theorem, we have ∫ ∫ R = ∫ ∂D12(0,10) − ∫ ∂D1(0,0) − ∫ ∂D1(0,10) . The signs are due to the “on your left rule”. Since the 2D curl is zero, the integral over R is zero. 0 = 2 − 1 − ∫ ∂D1(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r. Therefore ∫ ∂D1(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r = 1. (b) We now change ⃗F, so that it is no longer the vector ﬁeld from part (a). Suppose that we know instead 1 = ∫ ∂D12(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r 2 = ∫ ∂D12(0,−10) ⃗F · d⃗r 3 = ∫ ∂D100(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r. Page 5 of 12 Compute ∫ ∂D1(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r. Solution: Let x = ∫ ∂D1(0,−10) ⃗F · d⃗r, y = ∫ ∂D1(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r, z = ∫ ∂D1(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r We are looking for z, but x and y are also unknown. By the strategy we used in part (a), we know that 0 = 1 − y − z. Similarly, we also know that 0 = 2 − x − z. Finally, using the integral equal to 3, we obtain 0 = 3 − x − y − z. We can solve for z from these three equations. Substituting y = 1 − z and x = 2 − z into the ﬁnal equation gives 0 = 3 − (2 − z) − (1 − z) − z which gives the answer z = 0. Therefore ∫ ∂D1(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r = 0. Page 6 of 12 4. 10 marks Let C be the curve consisting of the three line segments C1 from (2, 0, 0) to (0, 2, 0), then C2 from (0, 2, 0) to (0, 0, 2) and ﬁnally C3 from (0, 0, 2) to (2, 0, 0). Let ⃗F = (sin x + z2, 2x2, y2). Compute the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r. Solution: We will use Stokes’ theorem, so we compute ∇ × F = (2y, 2z, 4x). The curve bounds a piece of a plane. To ﬁnd this plane from the 3 points given, we form two vectors v1 = (−2, 2, 0) and v2 = (0, −2, 2) and take their cross product n = v1 × v2 = (4, 4, 4). Therefore (1, 1, 1) is normal to the plane which goes through (2, 0, 0), and the equation of the plane is (x − 2) + y + z = 0. This is of the form z = f (x, y) = −x − y + 2, so n dS = (−fx, −fy, 1)dxdy = (1, 1, 1)dxdy where the sign is chosen from the right-hand rule. Therefore ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ S(2y, 2z, 4x) · (1, 1, 1)dxdy = ∫ ∫ S(2y + 2z + 4x)dxdy and substituting z = f (x, y) gives ∫ ∫ S(2x + 4)dxdy We now must ﬁnd the bounds of integration. From the sketch, we see that z ≥ 0. Substituting this inequality into z = f (x, y) gives −x − y + 2 ≥ 0, y ≤ 2 − x. Also from the sketch, we see that 0 ≤ y and 0 ≤ x ≤ 2. Therefore the double integral is ∫ 2 0 ∫ 2−x 0 (2x + 4)dydx = ∫ 2 0 (2x + 4)(2 − x)dx = ∫ 2 0 (8 − 2x2)dx which evaluates to \f \f \f \f 2 08x − 2 3x3 = 2 4 − 2 4 3 = 2 5 3 . Page 7 of 12 5. 10 marks Let S be the part of the paraboloid z = 2 − x2 − y2 contained in the cone z = √ x2 + y2 and oriented in the upward direction. Let ⃗F = (tan √z + sin y3, e −x2, z). Compute the ﬂux integral ∫∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS. Solution: The divergence of this vector ﬁeld is ∇ · F = 1. The surface S is not closed, so we must close the surface by introducing a bottom disc. To ﬁnd the z-height of this bottom disc, we substitute the cone equation z2 = x2 + y2 into the paraboloid inequation to get z = 2 − z2 which implies z2 + z − 2 = (z + 2)(z − 1) = 0 and so z = 1. The disc is inside the cone, so √ x2 + y2 ≤ 1. Altogether, the equations of the bottom disc needed to close the surface S is B = {z = 1, x2 + y2 ≤ 1}, ˆn = (0, 0, −1) Let V be the solid region with boundary ∂V = S + B. Then by the divergence theorem, ∫ ∫ ∫ V dV = ∫ ∫ S F · ˆn dS + ∫ ∫ B F · ˆn dS. We start with the triple integral. It can be setup as ∫ ∫ x2+y2≤1 ∫ 2−x2−y2 1 dzdxdy = ∫ ∫ x2+y2≤1(1 − x2 − y2)dxdy We can convert this to polar coordinates. ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 1 0 (1 − r2)rdrdθ = (2π) \f \f \f \f 1 0 1 2r2 − 1 4r4 = π 2 . Thus ∫ ∫ ∫ V dV = π 2 . Next, we compute the bottom piece ∫ ∫ B F · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ B(∗, ∗, 1) · (0, 0, −1) dS = −Area(B) = −π. Altogether, the ﬁnal answer is ∫ ∫ S F · ˆn dS = π 2 + π. Page 8 of 12 6. 10 marks Let S be the surface given by the equations x2 + z2 = 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, oriented with outward normal vector. Compute the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y, z) = (xz2, e xy, z3) across S. Solution: We parametrize the cylinder by r(θ, y) = (cos θ, y, sin θ), 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. The tangent vectors are rθ = ⟨− sin θ, 0, cos θ⟩, ry = ⟨0, 1, 0⟩ and their cross-product is rθ × ry = ⟨− cos θ, 0, − sin θ⟩, |rθ × ry| = 1. The outward unit normal is ˆn = ⟨cos θ, 0, sin θ⟩. The composition of F and r is F(r(θ, y)) = ⟨cos θ sin2 θ, e sin θy, sin 3 θ⟩, and so (F · ˆn)((r(θ, y))) = cos2 θ sin2 θ + sin4 θ = sin 2 θ. The ﬂux integral is then ∫ S F · ˆn dS = ∫ 1 0 ∫ 2π 0 (sin 2 θ)a dθdy = ∫ 2π 0 sin 2 θdθ. We compute ∫ 2π 0 sin 2 θdθ = 1 2 ∫ 2π 0 dθ − 1 2 ∫ 2π 0 cos(2θ)dθ = π − 0. Therefore the ﬂux is π. Page 9 of 12 7. 10 marks Let V = B1(0) be the ball of radius 1 centered at the origin, so that V = B1(0) = {x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ 1}. Let ˆn be the outward normal vector on ∂V . (a) Suppose ϕ is a smooth function on R3 satisfying ∇ 2ϕ = 0. Show that ∫ ∫ ∂V (ϕ ∇ϕ) · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V |∇ϕ| 2dV. Solution: Let ⃗F = ϕ ∇ϕ. The divergence theorem states ∫ ∫ ∂V ⃗F · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V ∇ · ⃗F dV. In terms of ⃗F = ϕ ∇ϕ, this identity is ∫ ∫ ∂V (ϕ ∇ϕ) · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V ∇ · (ϕ ∇ϕ)dV. We calculate ∇ · (ϕ ∇ϕ) = ∇ϕ · ∇ϕ + ϕ ∇ · ∇ϕ. We are given that ∇ · ∇ϕ = ∇ 2ϕ = 0. Therefore ∇ · (ϕ ∇ϕ) = ∇ϕ · ∇ϕ and so ∫ ∫ ∂V (ϕ ∇ϕ) · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V |∇ϕ| 2dV. (b) Suppose ⃗F is a C 1 vector ﬁeld on V satisfying • ∇ × ⃗F = ⃗0 (curl-free) • ∇ · ⃗F = 0 (divergence-free) • ⃗F · (x, y, z) = 0 (perpendicular to the radial vector ﬁeld (x, y, z)) Show that ⃗F ≡ 0 at all points on V . Solution: Since ⃗F is curl-free and C 1 on the simply-connected set V , by the second main theorem on conservative vector ﬁelds there exists a function ϕ : V → R such that ⃗F = ∇ϕ. Page 10 of 12 Since ∇ · ⃗F = 0, we have ∇2ϕ = 0. Therefore we are in the situation of part (a), and we have ∫ ∫ ∫ V |∇ϕ| 2dV = ∫ ∫ ∂V (ϕ ∇ϕ) · ˆn dS. The unit vector ˆn on the sphere is parallel to (x, y, z). Therefore the assumption ⃗F · (x, y, z) = 0 implies ∇ϕ · ˆn = 0 on ∂V . It follows that ∫ ∫ ∫ V |∇ϕ| 2dV = ∫ ∫ ∂V (ϕ ∇ϕ) · ˆn dS = 0. Since F = ∇ϕ, we conclude ∫ ∫ V |⃗F| 2dV = ∫ ∫ ∫ V |∇ϕ| 2dV = 0. Therefore |⃗F| 2 = 0 at all points in V , which means ⃗F ≡ 0. Page 11 of 12 8. 10 marks Let R > 0. Denote SR = {x2 + y2 + z2 = R2} to be the sphere of radius R centered at the origin. (a) Let ω > 0. A particle moves on the equator of the sphere SR with trajectory at t > 0 given by ⃗r(t) = (R cos √ ωt √R , R sin √ ωt √R , 0). Compute the normal component of the acceleration. Note: this calcula- tion can be very short. (b) Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = 2 (x2 + y2 + z2 + 1)3/2 ⟨x, y, z⟩. Compute the limit of the ﬂux integrals lim R→∞ ∫ ∫ SR ⃗F · ˆn dS, where ˆn is the outward normal. Solution: The normal component of the acceleration is |v| 2κ. The ve- locity is v = √ Rω(− sin √ ωt √R , cos √ωt √R , 0) so that |v| = √Rω. The curvature κ of a circle of radius R is 1/R. Therefore the normal component of the acceleration is |v| 2κ = Rω 1 R = ω. For the ﬂux integral, we note that the unit normal on the sphere is n = R−1(x, y, z). Therefore ∫ ∫ SR ⃗F · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ SR 2 (1 + R2)3/2 R−1R2dS = 8π (1 + R2)3/2 R3, and lim R→∞ ∫ ∫ SR ⃗F · ˆn dS = lim R→∞ 8π R3(R−2 + 1)3/2 R3 = 8π. Page 12 of 12","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
