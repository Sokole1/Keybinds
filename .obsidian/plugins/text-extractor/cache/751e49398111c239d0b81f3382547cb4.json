Since f(z,y) is continuous on R?, we know that the path-independence property implies that F is conservative. Since F is conservative, it satisfies 9, F, = 9, F}. We have 0\\ F, = 2Aze?(1+y) and 0, Fy = ze? 4+ zye? = zeÂ¥(1+y) by the product rule. Therefore, A =1/2.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
