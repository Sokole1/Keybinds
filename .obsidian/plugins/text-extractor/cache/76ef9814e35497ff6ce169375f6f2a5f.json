Suppose that the mass is also attached to a viscous damper with a damping constant of 20 dyn.s/cm. If the mass is pulled down an additional 2 cm and then released, ﬁnd its position u at any time t. (In CGS, the force unit is 1 dyn = 1 g·cm/s2, and the standard gravity is g = 980 cm/s2. Use 384 = 6*64). December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 6 of 12 5.
