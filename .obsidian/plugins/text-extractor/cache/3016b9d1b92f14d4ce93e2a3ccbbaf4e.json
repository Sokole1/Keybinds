If yes, then find it, correct to at least six decimal digits, and the corresponding zero; if not, then justify. Some pen-and-paper work is required here, before any computations are carried out. If you then use a numerical method to compute your answer, your method should use as few as possible function evaluations of hyperbolic functions (such as sinh or cosh).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
