(a) Consider the following objective, which considers a weighted absolute error with a penalty on the maximum coordinate-wise deviation away from some target value w® (that has elements w,wY, ... wY), n T 0 w) = vilw' x; —y;| + A max |w; —wy|, S0 =3 oz =l + 3 x| s = o) where A is a non-negative scalar. Re-write this objective function in matrix and norm notation. You can use V as a diagonal matrix with the (non-negative) elements v; along the diagonal. Make sure your dimensions match.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
