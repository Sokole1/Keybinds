We say that a vector ﬁeld ⃗F is conservative on a domain D if it is deﬁned on D and there is a scalar function ϕ deﬁned on D such that ⃗F = ∇ϕ on D. In the lecture, we have seen that the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y) = ⟨ −y x2 + y2 , x x2 + y2 ⟩ is not conservative on the domain R 2 \\ {(0, 0)}. In this exercise, we will show that ⃗F is conservative on a smaller domain. (a) Find the domain D of the function ϕ(x, y) = arctan(y/x). (b) Show that ⃗F is conservative on D (Hint: Compute ∇ϕ(x, y)). (c) Is D open? Is D connected? Give reasons for your answer. 2. Use Green’s Theorem to evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C(y + e √x)dx + (2x + cos y2)dy where C is the boundary of the region D enclosed by the parabolas y = x2 and x = y2, oriented counterclockwise. 3. Evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r where C is the triangle from (0, 0) to (0, 4) to (2, 0) to (0, 0) and ⃗F = ⟨y cos x − xy sin x, xy + x cos x⟩. 4. Use Green’s theorem to evaluate the line integral ∫ C y3dx − x3dy, where (a) C is the circle x2 + y2 = 4 oriented counterclockwise. (b) C is the upper-half of the circle x2 + y2 = 4 from (2, 0) to (−2, 0). 5. Let C be the upper half circle oriented from (2, 0) to (0, 0) along the circle (x−1) 2+y2 = 1. Sketch the curve C and then compute the line integral ∫ C(y2 + 1)dx + (xy + e tan y)dy. 6. Let ⃗F (x, y) = ⟨ y3 (x2 + y2)2 , −xy2 (x2 + y2)2 ⟩ for (x, y) ̸= (0, 0). Sketch curves and domains considered below. For this question, you will be graded on the presentation and cor- rectness of your logical argument. Make sure that your solution is clearly presented to receive full marks. (a) Let C1 be the unit circle centered at the origin oriented counter-clockwise. Com- pute ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r . Page 1 Math 317 Homework 3 (b) Let C2 be the unit circle centered at (5, −5) oriented counter-clockwise. Compute∫ C2 ⃗F · d⃗r . (c) Let C3 be the circle of radius 100 centered at (5, −5) oriented counter-clockwise. Compute ∫ C3 ⃗F · d⃗r . (d) Let D1 = R2 \\ {(0, 0)}. Determine if ⃗F is conservative on D1 or not. (e) Let D2 = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : y > 0}. Determine if ⃗F is conservative on D2 or not. (f) Let D3 = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : 1 < (x + 2)2 + y2 < 4}. Determine if ⃗F is conservative on D3 or not.
