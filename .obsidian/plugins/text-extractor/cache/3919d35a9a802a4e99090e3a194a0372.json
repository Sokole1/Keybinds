(3) Problem 8: Heat Conduction with Heat Loss and a Time-Dependent Source Solve the inhomogeneous heat conduction problem with heat loss, a time-dependent source, and subject to time-dependent boundary conditions: ut = uxx − u + e −t sin(x), 0 < x < π 2 , t > 0, u(0, t) = 0, ∂u(π/2, t) ∂x = e −t, u(x, 0) = x. (4) Problem 9: Motion of a String on an Elastic Foundation The motion of a string on an elastic foundation with stiﬀness γ satisﬁes the following initial-boundary value problem: utt = uxx − γu, 0 < x < 1, t > 0, u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0, u(x, 0) = 0, ut(x, 0) = g(x). (5) (a) Solve the PDE subject to the boundary conditions using the method of separation of variables.
