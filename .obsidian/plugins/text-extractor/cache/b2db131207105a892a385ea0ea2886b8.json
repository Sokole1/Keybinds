November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 2 of 7 1. Consider the following second order ODE: x′′ + 4x′ + 4x = 0. (1) (a)(4 points) Find the general solution of the ODE (1). Solution: (b)(4 points) Solve the ODE (1) with the initial conditions x(0) = 1 and x′(0) = v. Solution: (c)(2 points) For what values of v is x(t) > 0 for all t ≥ 0? Justify your answer. Solution: November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 3 of 7 2. (Do NOT use Laplace transform. Minus additional 1 point for using it.) An undamped spring is stretched 1 m by a force of 6 N. (1 N = 1 kg·m s2 .) A mass of 2 kg is attached at the end of the spring with position x = 0 m when the spring is at rest. A force is applied of 5t2 N. (Hint: The mass spring system has equation mx′′ + cx′ + kx = 0 where m is the mass attached to the spring, c is the damping coeﬃcient so that the damping force is −cx′, and k is the spring constant so that the force is −kx when the spring is stretched by x.) (a)(5 points) Write down the nonhomogeneous undamped spring equation and ﬁnd a particular solution. Solution: November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 4 of 7 (b)(5 points) Instead, a force is applied of 10 cos(ωt) N/m, where ω is the natural frequency of the spring. Solve for the position x(t) with x(0) = 5 and x′(0) = 0. (Hint: the particular solution will be of the form xp = At sin(ωt).) Solution: November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 5 of 7 3. (a)(6 points) Using the Laplace transform, ﬁnd the solution x1(t), called the impulse response, of the following initial value problem: x′′ 1 + 2x′ 1 + 2x1 = 0 x1(0) = 0, x′ 1(0) = 1. Solution: (b)(4 points) Let x2(t) be the solution of the following (diﬀerent) initial value problem: x′′ 2 + 2x′ 2 + 2x2 = f (t) x2(0) = 0, x′ 2(0) = 0. Find the solution x2(t) when the forcing f (t) = e−t is applied, knowing that the solution x2(t) veriﬁes: x2(t) = (x1 ∗ f )(t), where x1(t) is the solution of the previous question.
