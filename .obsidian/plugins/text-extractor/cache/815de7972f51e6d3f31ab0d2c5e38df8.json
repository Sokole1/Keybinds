Consider the curve given by ⃗r(t) = ( t 2 2 √2, t2 2 √ 2 , t 3 3 ) , 1 ≤ t ≤ 2. (a) Compute the arclength function s(t) from P = ⃗r(1) to ⃗r(t). (b) Reparametrize the curve with respect to arclength starting from P . 2. Let ⃗F = (−2y cos x sin x)ˆi + (cos2 x + 2(yz + 1)eyz)ˆj + (2y2eyz + 1)ˆk. (a) Find a potential for this vector ﬁeld, i.e. solve ⃗F = ∇ϕ. (b) Compute ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r where C is parametrized by ⃗r(t) = (cos t, sin t, cos 2 t) for times 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. 3. Let ∂Dr(⃗p) denote the circle of radius r centered at ⃗p ∈ R 2 oriented counter-clockwise. This means D100(0, 10) is a disc of radius 100 with center (0, 10). Let ⃗F = (F1, F2) be a C 1 vector ﬁeld on R 2\\{(0, 0), (0, −10), (0, 10)}. In other words, ⃗F may not be deﬁned (e.g. due to division by zero) at the three points (0, 0), (0, −10) and (0, 10) which are stacked vertically in a line. Suppose furthermore that ∂1F2 = ∂2F1 wherever ⃗F is deﬁned. (a) Knowing that 1 = ∫ ∂D1(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r, 2 = ∫ ∂D12(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r, compute the line integral ∫ ∂D1(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r. (b) We now change ⃗F, so that it is no longer the vector ﬁeld from part (a). Suppose that we know instead 1 = ∫ ∂D12(0,10) ⃗F · d⃗r, 2 = ∫ ∂D12(0,−10) ⃗F · d⃗r, 3 = ∫ ∂D100(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r. Compute ∫ ∂D1(0,0) ⃗F · d⃗r. 4. Let C be the curve consisting of the three line segments C1 from (2, 0, 0) to (0, 2, 0), then C2 from (0, 2, 0) to (0, 0, 2) and ﬁnally C3 from (0, 0, 2) to (2, 0, 0). Let ⃗F = (sin x + z2, 2x2, y2). Compute the line integral ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r. Page 1 Math 317 Practice Final - Good Luck Everybody! 5. Let S be the part of the paraboloid z = 2 − x2 − y2 contained in the cone z = √x2 + y2 and oriented in the upward direction. Let ⃗F = (tan √ z + sin y3, e −x2, z). Compute the ﬂux integral ∫∫ S ⃗F · ˆn dS. 6. Let S ⊂ R 3 be the surface given by the equations x2 + z2 = 1 with 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, oriented with outward normal vector. Compute the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y, z) = (xz2, e xy, z3) across S. 7. Let V = B1(0) be the ball of radius 1 centered at the origin, so that V = B1(0) = {x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ 1}. Let ˆn be the outward normal vector on ∂V . (a) Suppose ϕ is a smooth function on R 3 satisfying ∇2ϕ = 0. Show that ∫ ∫ ∂V (ϕ ∇ϕ) · ˆn dS = ∫ ∫ ∫ V |∇ϕ| 2dV. (b) Suppose ⃗F is a C 1 vector ﬁeld on V satisfying • ∇ × ⃗F = ⃗0 (curl-free) • ∇ · ⃗F = 0 (divergence-free) • ⃗F · (x, y, z) = 0 (perpendicular to the radial vector ﬁeld (x, y, z)) Show that ⃗F ≡ 0 at all points on V . 8. Let R > 0. Denote ∂BR = {x2 + y2 + z2 = R2} to be the sphere of radius R centered at the origin. (a) Let ω > 0. A particle moves on the equator of the sphere ∂BR with trajectory at t > 0 given by ⃗r(t) = (R cos √ωt √R , R sin √ωt √ R , 0). Compute the normal component of the acceleration. Note: this calculation can be very short. (b) Consider the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = 2 (x2 + y2 + z2 + 1)3/2 (x, y, z). Compute the limit of the ﬂux integrals lim R→∞ ∫ ∫ ∂BR ⃗F · ˆn dS, where ˆn is the outward normal. Page 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
