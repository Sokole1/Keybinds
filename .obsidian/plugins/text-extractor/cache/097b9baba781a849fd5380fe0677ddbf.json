Something-or-Others UBC recently replaced its aging steam heating system with a new hot water system. A set of locations needs water delivered and there’s another set of intermediate points through which we can deliver water. Some of these points can be connected—at varying costs—by laying new pipe, others cannot. You’d like to ﬁgure out the cheapest way to connect every delivery location to water. We can model the problem as a graph, by representing locations and intermediate points as nodes. Possible connections are represented as weighted edges, where the weight of an edge is the cost of laying pipe between its two endpoints. For simplicity, moving forward, we’ll assume that all costs are 1. 1. Build intuition through examples. Here’s an instance, where shaded nodes are in S. Indicate a solution to this problem, that is, a way to connect up all of the shaded nodes. Draw your own small examples. What are trivial instances? ∗Copyright Notice: UBC retains the rights to this document. You may not distribute this document without permission. 1 2. Formalize the problem as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize or maximize some- thing. Also, formalize the problem as a decision problem, where the answer is Yes or No. We’ll call the decision problem the Steiner Tree (ST) problem. What is an instance of ST? A potential solution? A good solution? 3. Think about similar problems by considering what an optimal solution to ST looks like. Is it a path? A cycle? A tree? A graph? Can we reduce ST to a similar problem we’ve seen before? 2 4. Prove that the ST (Steiner Tree) problem is in NP. Remember: it’s in NP if it’s \"eﬃciently certiﬁable\". The \"certiﬁcate\" is usually what we’d think of as a solution. 3","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
