No other material or accessories may be used. • You may use either pen or pencil, but exams written in pencil may not be eligible for regrading. • Please be prepared to present, upon request, a student card for identiﬁcation. • If you need more space, use the blank page at the end of the exam, and clearly indicate that your work continues there. • Most questions require a short answer. Work eﬃciently and avoid writing lengthy answers. • Unless otherwise stated, n refers to the number of training examples and d is the number of features. • If anything is unclear or seems ambiguous, state your assumptions. • Please look up occassionally in case there are clariﬁcations writte on the projection. • You are weclome to (quietly) leave early if you ﬁnish in under 50 minutes, but please do not leave in the last 5 minutes as it is very distracting to those who want to work up to the last minute. Question: 1 2 3 4 5 Total Points: 24 5 4 5 7 45 Score: G O O D L U C K !! CPSC 340 Midterm Exam Question 1. (24 points) Answer the questions below. Be concise: avoid spending valuable time on lengthy answers. (a)2 pts What does xij refer to in the notation we’ve been using in class? (b)2 pts Why shouldn’t you use the training error to choose the value of k in k-nearest neighbours? (c)2 pts What is the diﬀerence between a validation error and the test error? Page 1 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam (d)2 pts What is the eﬀect of the number of features d that our model uses on the two parts of the fundamental trade-oﬀ? (e)2 pts Explain why a random forest based on random trees of depth 10 could be viewed as a parametric classiﬁer. Explain why or why not it would be a parametric classiﬁer if we set the depth to ∞ in our code? (f)2 pts What is a disadvantage of using scatterplots as a method for outlier detection? Page 2 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam (g)2 pts Besides ﬁnding a clustering of the data, what is another use of the k-means algorithm? (h)2 pts What is wrong with using the code below for computing the validation error of a regression model on t examples? sum(yhat .!= y)/t (i)2 pts Describe a situation where it could be better to use gradient descent than the normal equations to solve a least squares problem. Page 3 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam (j)2 pts In regression, what is a situation where we would want to minimize the L1-norm error (∥Xw − y∥1) instead of the least squares error (∥Xw − y∥2)? (k)2 pts Why would we want to approximate the L∞-norm error with the log-sum-exp function? (l)2 pts Suppose that a famous person in the machine learning community is advertising their “extremely-deep convolutional fuzzy-genetic Hilbert-long-short recurrent neural network” classiﬁer, which has 500 hyper-parameters. This person claims that if you take 10 diﬀerent famous (and very-diﬃcult) datasets, and tune the 500 hyper-parameters based on each dataset’s validation set, that you can beat the current best-known validation set error on all 10 datasets. Explain whether or not this amazing claim is likely to be meaningful. Page 4 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam Question 2. (5 points) Consider the dataset below, which has 10 training examples, 2 features, and 3 classes: X =                 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0                 , y =                 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3                 . (a)3 pts What is a decision stump that minimizes the classiﬁcation error? Brieﬂy justify your choice. (b)2 pts How would your decision stump from part (a) classify the test example below? ˆx = [0 0] Page 5 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam Question 3. (4 points) Consider the dataset below, which has 5 training examples and 1 feature: X =       5 3 4 2 1       , y =       1 −0.5 −0.2 0 −0.1       . (a)2 pts Suppose we want to ﬁt a degree p = 2 polynomial to this dataset. Write a feature matrix Z that we could we use in a linear regression model to ﬁt such a quadratic model? (b)2 pts If we ﬁt the data set using our standard polynomial basis with p = 2 and obtained the regression weights w =   2 −3 0.5   , what value of yi would we predict for the test example ˆx = [2]? Page 6 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam Question 4. (5 points) (a)3 pts What is the time complexity of clustering using the k-medians algorithm? Answer using big-O notation with a brief explanation. Your answer may depend on n, d k, and/or the number of iterations T . You should assume a straightforward implementation of k-medians as in the assignment code. (b)2 pts Using the same conventions as part (a), what is the cost of clustering t new objects using a trained k-medians model? Page 7 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam Question 5. (7 points) (a)4 pts The tilted least squares objective function has the form f (w) = 1 2 n∑ i=1(wT xi − yi) 2 + d∑ j=1 wjvj, for a vector v with real-valued elements vj (you can use V as a diagonal matrix with the vi values along the diagonal, if you need it). Show how the minimizer of this (convex) function can be written as the solution of a linear system, explaining your steps. (b)3 pts Consider the weighted absolute error with a penalty on the largest regression weight, f (w) = n∑ i=1 vi|wT xi − yi| + λ max j |wj|, where the max is taken over j in {1, 2, . . . , d}, where vi ≥ 0 for all i, and where λ ≥ 0. Write this objective in matrix and norm notation. Page 8 of 9 CPSC 340 Midterm Exam This page is intentionally blank.
