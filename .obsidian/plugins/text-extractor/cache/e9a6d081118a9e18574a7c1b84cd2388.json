(You do not have to actually implement it in this way for the previous question, but you should think about how this could be done.) What is the cost of classifying ¢ test examples with the model and this way of computing the predictions? It’s preferable to leave your answer in terms of k and c if relevant.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
