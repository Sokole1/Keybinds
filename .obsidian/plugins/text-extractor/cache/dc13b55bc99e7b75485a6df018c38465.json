Note that all the functions below are convex, so finding a w with V f(w) = 0 is sufficient to minimize the functions — but show your work in getting to this point. 1. f(w) = §lw—v||? (projection of v onto real space). 2. f(w) = 4[| Xw — y||> + 3w Aw (least squares with weighted regularization). 3. f(w) =130 viw i — ;)% + §[lw —w®||? (weighted least squares shrunk towards non-zero w(®). Above we assume that v and w(®) are d x 1 vectors, and A is a d x d diagonal matrix (with positive entries along the diagonal). You can use V as a diagonal matrix containing the v; values along the diagonal. Hint: Once you convert to vector/matrix notation, you can use the results from class to quickly compute these quantities term-wise. As a spot check, make sure that the dimensions match for all quantities/operations: to do this, you may need to introduce an identity matrix. For example, X7 Xw + Aw can be re-written as (XTX + Aw.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
