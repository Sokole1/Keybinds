In the case F =0 we know that a solution is of the form i b, sin (m) ek L n=1 in which the b, are the coefficients in the Fourier sine expansion of f on [0, L]. For the non-homogeneous problem, we will take a cue from that case and attempt a solution > nr =3 Tu®sin (7). 2 uw) =3 Tuwsin (7 @ The problem is to determine each T;,(t). 1. By observing that, for a given ¢, equation (2) can be interpreted as the Fourier sine expansion of u(z, t), considered as a function of z, with T,(¢) being the nth Fourier coefficient in this expansion, carefully establish the expression for T},(t).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
