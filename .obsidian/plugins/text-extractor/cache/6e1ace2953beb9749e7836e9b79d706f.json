(Bonus question, optional, extra up to 5% of assignment grade) This question provides a glimpse into the pros and cons of higher-order methods. (a) Derive a third order method for solving f(z) = 0 in a way similar to the derivation of Newton’s method, using evaluations of f(zx), f'(zx) and f”(zx). To do this, use Taylor’s expansion with three terms plus a remainder term. Show that in the course of derivation a quadratic equation arises, and therefore two distinct schemes can be derived. Use cancellation error prevention considerations to determine the preferred choice of the two. (Here is where our discussion of the numerical solution of a quadratic equation may come handy.)","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
