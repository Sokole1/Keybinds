(a) −y′ + y = 4e 3x. Answer. The integrating factor is µ(t) = exp( ∫ −dx) = e −x. On multiplying the DE by µ(t) = e−x, we get e −xy′ − e −xy = −4e 2x, or (e −xy) ′ = −4e 2x. Hence e −xy = ∫ (−4e 2x)dx = −2e 2x + c. y = −2e 3x + c ex. (b) y′ = 4x(y − 1) 1/2, y > 1. Answer. The equation is separable and can be rewritten as dy (y − 1)1/2 = 4xdx. Integrating, we get 2(y − 1) 1/2 = 2x 2 + 2c. Thus y = 1 + (x 2 + c) 2. December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 3 of 12 2.(10 points) Solve the initial value problem (6xy − y3)dx + (4y + 3x 2 + bxy2)dy = 0, y(0) = 3, where b is a constant such that the diﬀerential equation is exact. Answer. Let M = 6xy − y3 and N = 4y + 3x2 + bxy2. Since the DE is exact, we get My = Nx, or 6x − 3y2 = 6x + by2. Thus b = −3. There is a ψ(x, y) such that ψx = 6xy − y3, (1) ψy = 4y + 3x 2 − 3xy2 (2) By (1), ψ = ∫ (6xy − y3)dx = 3x 2y − xy3 + h(y). By (2), 4y + 3x 2 − 3xy2 = ψy = 3x 2 − 3xy2 + h′(y), or h′(y) = 4y. Hence h(y) = 2y2 + c. Thus the general solution of the DE is given implicitly by the equation 3x 2y − xy3 + 2y2 = k, k is a constant. Using the initial condition y(0) = 3, we get k = 18. Hence the solution of the IVP is given implicitly by the equation 3x 2y − xy3 + 2y2 = 18. December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 4 of 12 3.(13 points) Use the method of variation of parameters to ﬁnd the general solution of the given diﬀerential equation. Then check your answer by using the method of undetermined coeﬃcients : y′′ + 2y′ + y = 3e −t Answer. The solution of the homogeneous equation is yc(t) = C1e −t + C2te −t The functions y1 = e−t and y2 = te−t form a fundamental set of solutions. The Wronskian of these functions is W (y1, y2) = e−2t. Using the method of variation of parameters, the particular solution is given by Yp(t) = u1(t)y1(t) + u2(t)y2(t) in which u1(t) = − ∫ te−t(3e−t) W (t) dt = −3t2/2 u2(t) = ∫ e−t(3e−t) W (t) dt = 3t Hence the particular solution found by using the method of variation of parameters is Yp(t) = −3t2e −t/2 + 3t2e −t = 3 2 t2e −t Now by using the method of undetermined coeﬃcients, since the nonhomogenous term is e−t the basic form of the particular solution Yp is Yp = Ae−t. Since Ae−t duplicates the term C1e−t in yc we should multiply by t2 (indeed, te−t duplicates C2te−t in yc). Thus, we set for the particular solution of the non homogeneous problem, Yp(t) = At2e −t Upon substitution, we obtain A = 3/2 which gives, Yp(t) = 3 2 t2e −t So we ﬁnd the same solution than by using the method of variation of parameters. Hence the general solution is y(t) = C1e −t + C2te −t + 3 2 t2e −t December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 5 of 12 4.(10 points) A mass of 1 g stretches a spring 5 cm. Suppose that the mass is also attached to a viscous damper with a damping constant of 20 dyn.s/cm. If the mass is pulled down an additional 2 cm and then released, ﬁnd its position u at any time t. (In CGS, the force unit is 1 dyn = 1 g·cm/s2, and the standard gravity is g = 980 cm/s2. Use 384 = 6*64). Answer. The spring constant is k = (1)(980)/5 = 196 dyne/cm. The I.V.P. for the motion is u′′ + 20u′ + 196u = 0 with u(0) = 2 u′(0) = 0 Here u is measured in cm and t in sec. The general solution of the D.E. is u = Ae −10t cos 4 √6t + Be −10t sin 4√6t Invoking the initial conditions, we require that A = 2 and B = 5/ √6. The solution is u = e −10t(2 cos 4√6t + 5 √6 sin 4√6t) December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 6 of 12 5. Solve the following initial value problems. (a)(10 points) { y′′ + y = uπ/2 + δ(t − π/6) y(0) = y′(0) = 0 Answer. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the ODE and then applying the initial conditions, we obtain s 2Y (s) + Y (s) = e − π 2 s s + ∫ ∞ 0 e −stδ(t − π/6)dt = e − π 2 s s + e − π 6 s. This yields Y (s) = e − π 2 s s(s2 + 1) + e − π 6 s (s2 + 1) . Now, using partial fractions we have e − π 2 s s(s2 + 1) = e − π 2 s ( 1 s − s (s2 + 1) ) = e − π 2 s s − se − π 2 s (s2 + 1) . It follows y(t) = L −1 { e − π 2 s s } − L −1 { se − π 2 s (s2 + 1) } + L −1 { e − π 6 s (s2 + 1) } . Hence, according to the Laplace transform table, we have y(t) = uπ/2(t) − uπ/2(t) sin(t) + uπ/6 sin(t − π/6) December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 7 of 12 (b)(10 points) { y′′ + 4y = 1 k [(t − 5)u5(t) − (t − 5 − k)u5+k(t)] y(0) = y′(0) = 0 Answer. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the ODE and then applying the initial conditions, we obtain s 2Y (s) + 4Y (s) = 1 k ( e−5s s2 − e−(5+k)s s2 ) . Solving for Y (s), we obtain Y (s) = 1 k ( e−5s s2(s2 + 4) − e−(5+k)s s2(s2 + 4) ) . We have (partial fractions) 1 s2(s2 + 4) = 1 4 ( 1 s2 − 1 s2 + 4 ) . It follows that L −1 { 1 s2(s2 + 4) } = t 4 − 1 8 sin 2t. Hence, according to the Laplace transform table, we have y(t) = 1 k [h(t − 5)u5(t) − h(t − 5 − k)u5+k(t)] where h(t) = t 4 − 1 8 sin 2t. December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 8 of 12 6.(10 points) For the linear system d dt X = [ 0 4 1 0 ] X, ﬁnd the general solution and plot a few trajectories. Answer. Denote the matrix by A. Its eigenvalues satisfy 0 = det(A − rI) = r2 − 4, so that the eigenvalues are r = ±2. The eigenvector ξ corresponding to r = 2 satisﬁes [ −2 4 1 −2 ] ξ = [ 0 0 ] . One can take ξ = [ 2 1 ] . The eigenvector ξ corresponding to r = −2 satisﬁes [ 2 4 1 2 ] ξ = [ 0 0 ] . One can take ξ = [ 2 −1 ] . The general solution is X(t) = c1 [ 2 1 ] e 2t + c2 [ 2 −1 ] e −2t Phase plane: omitted. December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 9 of 12 7.(10 points) Find the general solution of the following system. d dt X = [ 1 1 4 1 ] X + [ 2 −1 ] e t. Answer. Denote the matrix by A. Its eigenvalues satisfy 0 = det(A − rI) = (1 − r)(1 − r) − 4 = r2 − 2r − 3, so that the eigenvalues are r = 3, −1. The eigenvector ξ corresponding to r = 3 satisﬁes [ −2 1 4 −2 ] ξ = [ 0 0 ] . One can take ξ = [ 1 2 ] . The eigenvector ξ corresponding to r = −1 satisﬁes [ 2 1 4 2 ] ξ = [ 0 0 ] . One can take ξ = [ 1 −2 ] . The general solution to the homogeneous equation is Xc(t) = c1 [ 1 2 ] e 3t + c2 [ 1 −2 ] e −t. Based on the simple form of the right hand side, we use the method of undetermined coeﬃcients, and set Xp = [ a1 a2 ] et. Substitution into the ODE yields [ a1 a2 ] e t = [ 1 1 4 1 ] [ a1 a2 ] e t + [ 2 −1 ] e t. In scalar form, after canceling the exponential, we have a1 = a1 + a2 + 2, a2 = 4a1 + a2 − 1. Thus a1 = 1/4 and a2 = −2. So the general solution is X(t) = c1 [ 1 2 ] e 3t + c2 [ 1 −2 ] e −t + [ 1/4 −2 ] e t. December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 10 of 12 8. Consider the nonlinear system dx dt = x(y − 1), dy dt = 2 + x − y. (1) (a)(3 points) Find the Jacobian (partial derivative) matrix for the system (1). Answer. Deﬁning F (x, y) = x(y − 1) and G(x, y) = x − y + 2, we have J(x, y) = [ Fx(x, y) Fy(x, y) Gx(x, y) Gy(x, y) ] = [ y − 1 x 1 −1 ] . (b)(4 points) Find the critical points for the system (1). Answer. We ﬁrst note that dx dt will be zero only if x = 0 or y = 1. If x = 0, then we will have dy dt = 2 − y, which will be zero when y = 2. Meanwhile, if y = 1, we will have dy dt = 1 + x, and this will be zero when x = −1. It follows that the system (1) has two critical points at (0, 2) and (−1, 1). December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 11 of 12 (c)(8 points) Use the linear systems near each critical point to classify them, specifying both the type of critical point and whether it is (asymptotically) stable or unstable. If a critical point cannot be unambiguously classiﬁed using the linear systems, please indicate this in your answer. Answer. The linear system near (0, 2) is given by [ u′ v′ ] = [ 1 0 1 −1 ] [ u v ] , where u = x and v = y − 2. The eigenvalues of the coeﬃcient matrix are given by the roots of the quadratic polynomial r2 − 1 = 0, which are r = ±1. Since the eigenvalues are real and of opposite sign, we may unambiguously classify the critical point of the system (1) at (0, 2) as an unstable saddle point. Meanwhile, the linear system near (−1, 1) is given by [ u′ v′ ] = [ 0 −1 1 −1 ] [ u v ] , where now u = x + 1 and v = y − 1. The eigenvalues of the coeﬃcient matrix in this case are given by the roots of the quadratic polynomial r2 + r + 1 = 0, which are r = −1 ± i √3 2 . As the eigenvalues are complex conjugates with negative real part, we may unambiguously classify the critical point of the system (1) at (−1, 1) as an asymptotically stable spiral point. □ December 2009 Math 215/255 Sections 101–105 Final Exam Page 12 of 12 Table of Laplace transforms f (t) = L−1{F (s)} F (s) = L{f (t)} 1. 1 1 s , s > 0 2. eat 1 s − a , s > a 3. tn, n positive integer n! sn+1 , s > 0 4. tp, p > −1 Γ(p + 1) sp+1 , s > 0 5. sin(at) a s2 + a2 , s > 0 6. cos(at) s s2 + a2 , s > 0 7. sinh(at) a s2 − a2 , s > |a| 8. cosh(at) s s2 − a2 , s > |a| 9. eat sin(bt) b (s − a)2 + b2 , s > a 10. eat cos(bt) s − a (s − a)2 + b2 , s > a 11. tneat, n positive integer n!
