Explain what the Internet is, and how (generally) it is put together B. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of packet vs circuit switching C. Define the term protocol in the context of a computer network D. List the layers of the Internet protocol stack, in their proper order, and what functions each layer performs E. Explain encapsulation and the structure of packets flowing in the Internet CPSC 317 - Module 1 2CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Internet • As a network of networks, the internet has many routers 3 local ISP company network regional ISP router workstation server mobile gateway CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Packet Switches and Routers • To get a packet to its recipient, each machine sends it to the router that is believed to be closest to the destination • Similar to a road intersection • Router looks up destination IP address in a forwarding table to determine next Hop • There may be several possible paths to take 4CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Circuit vs Packet Switching Revisited • When using circuit switching, the decision about the route that the data will take from source to destination is made once when the connection is established • When using packet switching, this decision is made for every packet • Does this have any impact on reliability? • Does this have any impact on performance? 5CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Question Assume A creates a 100kbps circuit to B, and A sends data at an average rate of 25kbps. What is A’s utilization of the network resources? Express your answer as a percent. 6CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker ANSWER Assume A creates a 100kbps circuit to B, and A sends data at an average rate of 25kbps. What is A’s utilization of the network resources? Express your answer as a percent. Utilization = used rate/available rate 25kbps / 100kbps = 0.25 or 25% 7CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Question Assume A creates a 100kbps circuit to B, and A sends data at an average rate of 25kbps. Can the network use these idle resources for other traffic? A. Yes B. No 8CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker Answer Assume A creates a 100kbps circuit to B, and A sends data at an average rate of 25kbps. Can the network use these idle resources for other traffic? A. Yes B. No Those resources are committed to that circuit and must be available to it if they are needed. 9CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocols 10CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi What’s a protocol? a human protocol and a computer network protocol: 11 Hi Hi Got the time? 2:00 TCP connection request TCP connection response Get http://www.awl.com/kurose-ross <file> time CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocols • A protocol defines: • Roles of communicating entities • Format of messages • Order of messages • Actions taken on the transmission, receipt of a message, or other event • A fully-defined protocol must provide a proper action for any event in any state 12CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Request-Response Protocols • Many protocols on the Internet are request-response protocols • Requestor (usually client) sends a request • Receiver (usually server) sends a response • Well-defined rules for whose turn it is • Some rules can be complicated • Server is slow to respond • Size of request or response can vary 13 Client Server Request Response CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocol Stack Application Transport Network Link Physical 14 HTTP (Web), Email, DNS, Multimedia, etc. CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocol Stack Application Transport Network Link Physical 15 HTTP (Web), Email, DNS, Multimedia, etc. TCP, UDP CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocol Stack Application Transport Network Link Physical CPSC 317 2023W2 © 2021 16 HTTP (Web), Email, DNS, Multimedia, etc. TCP, UDP IP CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocol Stack Application Transport Network Link Physical 17 HTTP (Web), Email, DNS, Multimedia, etc. TCP, UDP IP Ethernet 802.11b/g/n 1000BASE-T Operating System Hardware CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi An Analogy – Sending My Tax Return to CRA • Application Layer: My personal tax income is filed and posted to CRA • Transport Layer: The courier service responsible for delivering my tax data. • Network Layer: Routing instructions guiding the courier to the CRA office. • Link Layer: Local delivery routes within our city or neighborhood leading to the CRA office. 18CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Sending Data through the Stack 19 Application Transport Network Application Transport Network Client Server CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi As a network of networks, the internet has many routers 20 local ISP company network regional ISP router workstation server mobile gateway CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Sending Data through the Stack 21 Application Transport Network Link Application Transport Network Link Network Link Link Physical medium Physical medium Client ServerRouter CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocol Layering and Data Each layer takes data from above • adds header information to create new data unit • passes new data unit to layer below 22 application transport network link physical application transport network link physical source destination M M M M Ht HtHn HtHnHl M M M M Ht HtHn HtHnHl message segment datagram frame CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Encapsulation 23 message segment datagram frame source application transport network link physical HtHnHl M HtHn M Ht M M destination application transport network link physical HtHnHl’ M HtHn M Ht M M network link physical link physical HtHn’Hl’ M HtHn M HtHnHl M HtHn M HtHnHl M HtHnHl M router switch CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Protocol Stack: Responsibilities • Transport layer: • Identifies process on machine • Maybe resource within process (e.g., browser tab) • Ensures data arrives in order (if required) • Recovers lost data (if required) • Network layer: • Routes datagrams through routers to destination machine • Link layer: • Routes frames to adjacent machines (“direct” connection) • Physical layer: • Encodes data appropriately for the physical medium 24CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Summary of Module 1 • The Internet is a network of networks • End systems and routers • How is data sent? • Data is chopped into packets • Each packet has its destination address • Protocol stack • Each layer is responsible for a function • A protocol layer, in an abstract way, “talks” to a corresponding layer in another machine at the same level • Each layer requests services from the layer below it 25CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi In-class activity • Form yourselves into groups (1 – 9 students per group) • You should be able to chat conveniently in your group • Go to PrairieLearn • Click on Assessments • Start the ICA12 assessment (Protocol Layers) • Talk in your group about the answers • Hearing other students ideas • Explaining your ideas to others 26CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Switching Protocols Maryam R.Aliabadi Next Topic: Internet Performance 27","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
