For instance, abed lem(@.b.e.d) = < abe, abd, acd, bed) v ‘The correct ged to take is not of the individual terms a, b, ¢, d but the products of all the complementary terms (which looks the same in the two-variable case).

But there do exist generalizations. For example, using the standard ged notation (x,y,...) = ged(x,y, ...), we have 23 abe Theorem lem(a.b.c) = @t - Proof abcln — abe !l nbe,nca,nab — abe | (nbe,nca, nab) = nbe, ca, ab) abe | - X Iy (be,ca,ab) | Hence the claimed equality follows by the (universal) definition of lem.
