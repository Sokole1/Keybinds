Solve this diﬀerential equation using an integrating factor. b. Expand the above solution in a Taylor series about the point x0 =0. For what values of x does this series fail to converge? c. Now assume a power series solution of the form y(x)= ∞P n=0 anxn. Sub- stitute this series into the diﬀerential equation (1) and obtain a recursion for the coeﬃcients an. Use this recursion to determine the series representation of solution. Compare this result to the series obtained in part b above. Is there any relationship between the points of divergence of the series and the coeﬃcient (1 − x2) of the derivative in (1)? 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
