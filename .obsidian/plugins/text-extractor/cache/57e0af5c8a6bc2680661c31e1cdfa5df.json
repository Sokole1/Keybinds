Find the velocity, speed and acceleration at time t of the particle whose position is ⃗r (t) = a cos t ̂ııı + a sin t ̂ + ct ̂k . Describe the path of the particle. Solution. ⃗r (t) = a cos t ̂ııı + a sin t ̂ + ct ̂k ⃗v(t) = ⃗r ′(t) = −a sin t ̂ııı + a cos t ̂ + c ̂k ds dt (t) = |⃗r ′(t)| = √ a2 + c2 ⃗a(t) = ⃗r ′′(t) = −a cos t ̂ııı − a sin t ̂ As t runs over an interval of length 2π, (x, y) traces out a circle of radius a and z increases by 2πc. The path is a helix with radius a and with each turn having height 2πc. 2. Find a vector function that represents the curve of intersection of (a) the cone z = √ x2 + y2 and the plane z = 1 + y. (b) the plane z = 2x + 3y and the cylinder x2 + y2 = 9 Solution. (a) Eliminating z we get 1 + y = √ x2 + y2. Thus y ≥ −1 and (1 + y) 2 = x2 + y2, or 1 + 2y = x2. We can set x = t and solve for y and z: x = t, y = 1 2 (t 2 − 1), z = 1 2 (t 2 + 1), (t ∈ R). Remark. The intersection curve is a parabola. (b) We can parametrize the circle x2 + y2 = 9 as x(θ) = 3 cos θ, y(θ) = 3 sin θ with θ running from 0 to 2π. As z = 2x + 3y, the ellipse can be parametrized by x(θ) = 3 cos θ, y(θ) = 3 sin θ, z(θ) = 6 cos θ + 9 sin θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π 3. (a) Sketch the plane curve given by the vector equation ⃗r(t) = 4 sin t̂ııı − 2 cos t̂ . (b) Let 0 ≤ θ ≤ π be the angle between ⃗r(t) and ⃗r′(t) at t = 3π/4. Compute cos θ and determine whether θ < π/2, θ = π/2, or θ > π/2. (c) Sketch the position vector ⃗r(t) and the tangent vector ⃗r ′(t) at t = 3π/4. Solution. Page 1 Math 317 Homework 1 Name (a) The curve satisﬁes (x/4)2 + (y/2) 2 = 1 which is an ellipse. The graph is given later. (b) ⃗r′(t) = 4 cos t̂ııı + 2 sin t̂ . Recall cos(3π/4) = − √2/2 and sin(3π/4) = √2/2. Thus ⃗r(3π/4) = 2√2̂ııı + √2̂ , ⃗r′(3π/4) = −2 √ 2̂ııı + √2̂ , so that ⃗r(3π/4) ·⃗r ′(3π/4) = −8 + 2 = −6. Since |⃗r(3π/4)| = |⃗r′(3π/4)| = √10, we obtain cos θ = ⃗r(3π/4) · ⃗r ′(3π/4) |⃗r(3π/4)||⃗r′(3π/4)| = −6/10 = −3/5. Since cos θ < 0, it follows that θ > π/2. (c) 4. Find the velocity and position vectors of a particle that has the given acceleration and the given initial velocity and position: ⃗a(t) = sin t̂ııı + 2 cos t̂ + 6t ̂k , ⃗v(0) = − ̂k , ⃗r(0) = ̂ − 4 ̂k . Solution. We have ⃗v(t) = ⃗v(0) + ∫ t 0 ⃗a(u)du = (0, 0, −1) + ∫ t 0 (sin u, 2 cos u, 6u)du = (1 − cos t, 2 sin t, 3t 2 − 1) ⃗r (t) = ⃗r (0) + ∫ t 0 ⃗v(u)du = (0, 1, −4) + ∫ t 0 (1 − cos u, 2 sin u, 3u 2 − 1)du = (0, 1, −4) + (t − sin t, 2 − 2 cos t, t 3 − t) = (t − sin t, 3 − 2 cos t, t 3 − t − 4) Page 2 Math 317 Homework 1 Name Remark. You can also use indeﬁnite integrals to get ⃗v(t) and ⃗r (t). 5. Find parametric equations for the tangent line to the curve x = e −t cos t, y = e −t sin t, z = e −t at the point (1, 0, 1). Solution. The point corresponds to e −t = 1, i.e., t = 0. For ⃗r(t) = ⟨e−t cos t, e −t sin t, e −t⟩ we have ⃗r ′(t) = (e −t(− cos t − sin t), e−t(cos t − sin t), −e −t) ⃗r ′(0) = (−1, 1, −1), The vector equation of the tangent line is (1, 0, 1)+u(−1, 1, −1), u ∈ R. The parametric equations are x = 1 − u, y = u, z = 1 − u, (u ∈ R). 6. Let C be the curve of intersection of the parabolic cylinder x2 = 2y and the surface 3z = xy. Find the length of C from the origin to the point (6, 18, 36). Solution. If we choose x as our parameter t, then we can solve y = 1 2t2 and z = 1 3xy = 1 6t 3. So C is parametrized by ⃗r(t) = ⟨t, 1 2t 2, 1 6t 3⟩. The origin is ⃗r(0) while (6, 18, 36) = ⃗r(6). Thus the curve is for 0 ≤ t ≤ 6. We have ⃗r ′(t) = ⟨1, t, 1 2t2⟩, |⃗r′(t)| = ( 1 + t 2 + 1 4 t 4)1/2 = 1 + 1 2t2. Thus L = ∫ 6 0 |⃗r ′(t)|dt = ∫ 6 0 (1 + 1 2t 2)dt = [t + 1 6t 3]6 0 = 42. 7. Find the arc length function of the curve ⃗r(t) = t2̂ııı + 9t̂ + 4t 3/2 ̂k , 0 < t < ∞ measured from the point P = ⃗r(1) in the direction of increasing t. Solution. ⃗r ′(t) = (2t, 9, 6t 1/2). |⃗r′(t)| = ( 4t 2 + 81 + 36t )1/2 = |2t + 9| = 2t + 9. Thus the arc-length function is s(t) = ∫ t 1 |⃗r ′(u)|du = ∫ t 1 (2u + 9)du = [u 2 + 9u]t 1 = t 2 + 9t − 10. Page 3 Math 317 Homework 1 Name 8. Find the arc length function for the curve ⃗r(t) = e t sin t̂ııı + e t cos t̂ + √2e t ̂k measured from the point P (0, 1, √ 2) in the direction of increasing t, and then reparametrize the curve respect to arc length starting from P . Solution. We have ⃗r ′(t) = ⟨e t(sin t + cos t), e t(− sin t + cos t), √ 2et⟩, |⃗r ′(t)| = (e 2t [ (sin t + cos t)2 + (− sin t + cos t) 2 + 2])1/2 = 2et. Thus s(t) = ∫ t 0 |⃗r ′(u)|du = ∫ t 0 2e udu = 2e t − 2. We solve s = 2et − 2 for t, then et = s + 2 2 , t = ln s + 2 2 , and get the arc-length parametrization ⃗rarc(s) = ⃗r ( ln s + 2 2 ) = s + 2 2 ( sin ( ln s + 2 2 ) ̂ııı + cos ( ln s + 2 2 ) ̂ + √2 ̂k ) .
