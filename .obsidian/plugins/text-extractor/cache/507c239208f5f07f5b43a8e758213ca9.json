Endian Differences Consider the following code: uint16_t datal[4]; for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { datal[i]l = ix10; } uintl6_t *ptr = data + 2; *xptr = 300; *(ptr+l) = 400; Assume that the data array begins at address 0x100. Below we ask for bytes in memory as hexadecimal. Your answer should give us the bytes from memory in left-to-right (lowest address to highest address) order. Now, give the 8 bytes in memory in hexadecimal beginning at address 0x100 assuming that this is a little- endian machine: 0Ox e Next, give the 8 bytes in memory in hexadecimal beginning at address 0x100 assuming that this is a big- endian machine: 0Ox e","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
