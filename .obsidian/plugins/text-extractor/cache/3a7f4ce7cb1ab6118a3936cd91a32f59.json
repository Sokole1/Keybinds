Then ru is a primitive root modulo n if and only if (t, u) = 1. • If a positive integer n has a primitive root, then it has a total of ϕ(ϕ(n)) incongruent primitive roots. • ( Lagrange’s Theorem) Let f (x) = anxn +an−1xn−1 +· · ·+a1x+a0 be a polynomial of degree n, n ≥ 1, with integer coeﬃcients and with leading coeﬃcient an not divisible by p. Then f (x) has at most n incongruent roots modulo p. • Let p be a prime and let d be a divisor of p − 1. Then the polynomial has exactly d incongruent roots modulo p. • Let p be a prime and let d be a positive divisor of (p−1). Then the number of positive integers less than p of order d modulo p does not exceed ϕ(d). • Every prime has a primitive root. • If p is an odd prime with primitive root r, then either r or r + p is a primitive root mod p2. Further, r is a primitive root mod p and p2 when rp−1 ̸≡ 1 mod p2. • Let p be an odd prime. Then pk has a primitive root for all positive integers k. Moreover, if r is a primitive root modulo p2, then r is a primitive root modulo pk for all positive integers k. • For positive integers k ≥ 3, the integers 2k do not have primitive roots. No power of 2 other that 2 and 4 have primitive roots. • The positive integer n, n > 1, possesses a primitive root if and only if n = 2, 4, pt, or 2p t, where p is an odd prime and t is a positive integer. 1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
