We say that a vector ﬁeld ⃗F is conservative on a domain D if it is deﬁned on D and there is a scalar function ϕ deﬁned on D such that ⃗F = ∇ϕ on D. In the lecture, we have seen that the vector ﬁeld ⃗F(x, y) = ⟨ −y x2 + y2 , x x2 + y2 ⟩ is not conservative on the domain R 2 \\ {(0, 0)}. In this exercise, we will show that ⃗F is conservative on a smaller domain. (a) Find the domain D of the function ϕ(x, y) = arctan(y/x). (b) Shows that ⃗F is conservative on D (Hint: Compute ∇ϕ(x, y)). (c) Is D open? Is D connected? Give reasons for your answer. Solution. (a) Since arctan is deﬁned on R, ϕ(x, y) is deﬁned as long as y/x is a real number. This happens precisely when x ̸= 0. Therefore, the domain is D = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : x ̸= 0}, which is R 2 minus the y-axis. (b) We check that ϕ is the potential for ⃗F on D; by the chain rule ∂1ϕ(x, y) = 1 1 + (y/x)2 ∂1(y/x) = 1 1 + (y/x)2 −y x2 = −y x2 + y2 . ∂2ϕ(x, y) = 1 1 + (y/x)2 ∂2(y/x) = 1 1 + (y/x)2 1 x = x x2 + y2 . This veriﬁes that ∇ϕ = ⃗F on D. Therefore ⃗F is conservative on D. (c) D is open. Fix any point (u, v) ∈ D. Since u ̸= 0, we know that |u| > 0. Consider the ball of radius |u|/2 centered at (u, v). This ball is contained in D since for any point (x, y) in the ball, |x| ≥ |u|/2 > 0. (This claim is geometrically clear. It can be proved using the triangle inequality, but we don’t require a rigorous proof here.) D is not connected; if we choose the points (-1,0) and (1,0) from D, there is no continuous path lying on D connecting these points. 2. Use Green’s Theorem to evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C(y + e √x)dx + (2x + cos y2)dy where C is the boundary of the region D enclosed by the parabolas y = x2 and x = y2, oriented counterclockwise. Solution. Denote F1 = y + e √x and F2 = 2x + cos y2. By Green Theorem, I = ∫ D ∂1F2 − ∂2F1dA = ∫ D(2 − 1)dA = Area(D) = ∫ 1 0 ∫ √x x2 dydx = ∫ 1 0 x1/2 − x2dx = [2 3x3/2 − 1 3x3]1 0 = 1 3 . Page 1 Math 317 Homework 3 3. Evaluate the line integral I = ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r where C is the triangle from (0, 0) to (0, 4) to (2, 0) to (0, 0) and ⃗F = ⟨y cos x − xy sin x, xy + x cos x⟩. Solution. Denote the region inside the triangle by D. Note ∂1(xy + x cos x) − ∂2(y cos x − xy sin x) = y + cos x − x sin x − cos x + x sin x = y. By Green Theorem, and noting that the curve −C is counterclockwise, I = − ∫ −C ⃗F · d⃗r = − ∫ ∫ D y dA = − ∫ 2 0 ∫ 4−2x 0 y dy dx = − ∫ 2 0 1 2 (4 − 2x) 2dx = −2 ∫ 2 0 (x − 2) 2dx = −2 3 [(x − 2) 3]2 0 = −16 3 4. Use Green’s theorem to evaluate the line integral ∫ C y3dx − x3dy, where (a) C is the circle x2 + y2 = 4 oriented counterclockwise. (b) C is the upper-half of the circle x2 + y2 = 4 from (2, 0) to (−2, 0). Solution. (a) Denote F1 = y3 and F2 = −x3. Denote the disc x2 + y2 ≤ 4 by D. We have ∂1F2 − ∂2F1 = −3x2 − 3y2. By Green Theorem, ∫ C y3dx − x3dy = ∫ ∫ D(−3x2 − 3y2)dA = −3 ∫ ∫ D(x2 + y2)dA Using polar coordinates r, θ, I = −3 ∫ 2π 0 ∫ 2 0 r2 rdrdθ = −3 · 2π · [r4/4 ]2 0 = −24π. (b) Let R = {(x, y) : x2 + y2 ≤ 4, y ≥ 0} be the upper half disc. Its boundary is ∂R = C + L where L is the line segment from (-2,0) to (2,0). By Green’s theorem, ∫ ∫ R(−3x2 − 3y2)dA = ∫ ∂R y3dx − x3dy = ∫ C y3dx − x3dy + ∫ L y3dx − x3dy, we ﬁnd that∫ C y3dx − x3dy = ∫ ∫ R(−3x2 − 3y2)dA − ∫ L y3dx − x3dy. (1) Page 2 Math 317 Homework 3 Using polar coordinates, ∫ ∫ R(−3x2 − 3y2)dA = −3 ∫ π 0 ∫ 2 0 r2 rdrdθ = −3 · π · [r4/4 ]2 0 = −12π. We parametrize L by ⃗r (t) = ⟨t, 0⟩, −2 ≤ t ≤ 2. Then dx = 1dt and dy = 0dt. Therefore, ∫ L y3dx − x3dy = ∫ 2 −2 0dt − t 3 · 0dt = 0. From (1), we obtain ∫ C y3dx − x3dy = −12π − 0 = −12π. 5. Let C be the upper half circle from (2, 0) to (0, 0) along the circle (x − 1) 2 + y2 = 1. Sketch the curve C and then compute the line integral ∫ C(y2 + 1)dx + (xy + e tan y)dy. Solution. We compute ∂1F2 − ∂2F1 = y − 2y = −y. Since ∂1F2 − ∂2F1 ̸= 0, the vector ﬁeld is not conservative. However, ∂1F2 − ∂2F1 is simple and this suggests a use of Green’s theorem. The issue is that the curve C is not closed. In order to apply Green’s theorem, we introduce the line segment L from (0, 0) to (2, 0). Then C + L is simple closed, oriented counter-clockwise. Let R be the region bounded by the curve C + L. Then by Green’s theorem we know that ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r + ∫ L ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ C+L ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ R −ydA. Solving this for ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r , we get ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ R −ydA − ∫ L ⃗F · d⃗r . (2) We compute the line integral along L. We parametrize L by ⃗r (t) = ⟨t, 0⟩, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2. Then ⃗r ′(t) = ⟨1, 0⟩, so ⃗F (⃗r (t)) · ⃗r ′(t) = F1(⃗r (t)) = 1 for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 2. Therefore, ∫ L ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ 2 0 1dt = 2. (3) Next, we compute the double integral over R. We may describe R by R = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, 0 ≤ y ≤ √1 − (x − 1)2}. Page 3 Math 317 Homework 3 Therefore, ∫ ∫ R −ydA = ∫ 2 0 ∫ √1−(x−1)2 0 −ydydx. = −1 2 ∫ 2 0 1 − (x − 1) 2dx = −2 3 . Plugging this and (3) into (2), we get ∫ C ⃗F · d⃗r = −2 3 − 2 = −8 3 . 6. Let ⃗F (x, y) = ⟨ y3 (x2 + y2)2 , −xy2 (x2 + y2)2 ⟩ for (x, y) ̸= (0, 0). (a) Let C1 be the unit circle centered at the origin oriented counter-clockwise. Com- pute ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r . (b) Let C2 be the unit circle centered at (5, −5) oriented counter-clockwise. Compute∫ C2 ⃗F · d⃗r . (c) Let C3 be the circle of radius 100 centered at (5, −5) oriented counter-clockwise. Compute ∫ C3 ⃗F · d⃗r . (d) Let D1 = R2 \\ {(0, 0)}. Determine if ⃗F is conservative on D1 or not. (e) Let D2 = {(x, y) ∈ R2 : y > 0}. Determine if ⃗F is conservative on D2 or not. (f) Let D3 = {(x, y) ∈ R 2 : 1 < (x + 2)2 + y2 < 4}. Determine if ⃗F is conservative on D3 or not. Solution. (a) We parametrize C1 by ⃗r (t) = ⟨cos t, sin t⟩, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then ⃗F (⃗r (t)) · ⃗r ′(t) = ⟨sin 3 t, − cos t sin 2 t⟩ · ⟨− sin t, cos t⟩ = − sin 4 t − cos 2 t sin2 t = − sin 2 t(sin 2 t + cos2 t) = − sin 2 t. Therefore, ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ 2π 0 − sin2 tdt = ∫ 2π 0 −1 − cos(2t) 2 dt = −π. (b) Let R2 be the region enclosed by C2. Note that it does not include (0, 0). There- fore, ⃗F has continuous partial derivatives on R2 and we may apply Green’s theorem on R2. Page 4 Math 317 Homework 3 By applying the product rule, we get ∂1F2 = −y2 (x2 + y2)2 − 2 2x(−xy2) (x2 + y2)3 = 3x2y2 − y4 (x2 + y2)3 , ∂2F1 = 3y2 (x2 + y2)2 − 2 2y(y3) (x2 + y2)3 = 3x2y2 − y4 (x2 + y2)3 . So we see that ∂1F2 − ∂2F1 = 0 whenever (x, y) ̸= (0, 0). Therefore, by Green’s theorem ∫ C2 ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ R2 0dA = 0. (c) Since the region enclosed by C3 contains (0, 0) where ⃗F is not deﬁned, we cannot directly apply Green’s theorem. However, if we let R be the region between the curve C3 and the unit circle C1, then ⃗F has continuous partial derivatives on R. Therefore, we may apply Green’s theorem for the region R. Note that the boundary of R is ∂R = C3 − C1. Therefore, ∫ ∂R ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ C3 ⃗F · d⃗r − ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r . On the other hand, by Green’s theorem, ∫ ∂R ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ ∫ R ∂1F2 − ∂2F1dA = 0. Therefore, it follows that ∫ C3 ⃗F · d⃗r = ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r = −π. (d) It is not conservative on D1. If otherwise, since C1 is a closed curve on D, we should have ∫ C1 ⃗F · d⃗r = 0. But this is not the case as we computed in (a). (e) Since D2 does not contain (0, 0), ⃗F has continuous partial derivatives on D2 and we know that ∂1F2 − ∂2F1 = 0 on D2 from (b). Moreover, D2 is an open and simply connected domain. Therefore, ⃗F is conservative on D2. (f) The domain D3 has a hole, so it is not simply connected, so we cannot apply the theorem proved in the lecture. However, arguing as in (d), we see that ⃗F is conservative on the left half-space {(x, y) : x < 0}. Since D3 is a subset of the half-space, ⃗F is conservative on D3 because the potential on {(x, y) : x < 0} also works as a potential for D3. Page 5","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
