Consider the following inhomogeneous initial boundary value problem for the heat equa- tion ut = uxx + et cos( 5x 2 ) + 1 t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ π, BC: ux(0, t) = 0, and u(π, t) = t, IC: u(x, 0) = 0 Solve this problem by using an expansion in terms of the appropriate eigenfunctions, which correspond to the homogeneous form of the stated boundary conditions. (Note: Only show cases that give non-trivial solutions when solving the eigenvalue problems.) [total 60 marks] 2 Question 1 (continued): 3 Question 1 (continued): 4 2. Consider the following initial boundary value problem for the wave equation utt = uxx t > 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, BC: ux(0, t) = 0, and ux(2, t) = 0, IC: u(x, 0) = 0, ut(x, 0) = g(x) = { 0 if 0 ≤ x < 1 1 if 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 (a) Solve this problem using the method of separation of variables. (Note: Only show cases that give non-trivial solutions when solving the eigenvalue problems.) [30 marks] (b) Sketch the periodic extension that you would assume for the function g(x) on the in- terval [−6, 6]. [4 marks] (c) Use the D’Alembert’s solution (see the formula sheet) to ﬁnd the solution at x = 1 and t = 4, i.e., u(1, 4).
