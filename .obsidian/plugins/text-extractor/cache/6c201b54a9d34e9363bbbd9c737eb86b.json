Select the best of these three choices and then: o If the statement is always true, (1) give and very briefly explain an example instance in which it is true and (2) sketch the key points of a proof that it is always true. o If the statement is never true, (1) give and very briefly explain an example instance in which it is false and (2) sketch the key points of a proof that it is never true. o If the statement is sometimes true, (1) give and very briefly explain an example instance in which it is true and (2) give and very briefly explain an example instance in which it is false. Note that you will always select a choice and then give two answers. There is space for this below. 1. In a connected graph with n > 3 nodes, at most n â€” 1 nodes are diametric. (Recall: the diameter of a graph is the maximum over any pair of nodes of the shortest distance between that pair of nodes. Further, if the shortest path from 7 to j in a graph is the diameter, we say that each of i and j is diametric.) [4 marks]| Circle one: ALWAYS SOMETIMES NEVER 1) (2 2. A DAG (directed, acyclic graph) with at least two nodes is strongly connected. NOTE: for this problem, we assume that a strongly connected directed graph is one in which each node is reachable from each other node besides itself. Thus, any DAG with zero or one nodes is strongly connected. [4 marks| Circle one: ALWAYS SOMETIMES NEVER (1) )","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
