Variants of Hoare’s original algorithm are still a sorting method of choice today. Here you’ll gain experience with the divide and conquer algorithmic design approach, as well as recurrence analysis, that led Hoare to this breakthrough, and see an application also to finding the median. Here is a basic version of Quicksort, when the array A[1..n] to be sorted has n distinct elements: function QUICKSORT(A[1..n]) > returns the sorted array A of n distinct numbers if n > 1 then Choose pivot element p = A[1] Let Lesser be an array of all elements from A less than p Let Greater be an array of all elements from A greater than p LesserSorted < QuickSort(Lesser) GreaterSorted <+ QuickSort(Greater) return the concatenation of LesserSorted, [p], and GreaterSorted else return A 1 Quicksort Runtime Analysis 1. Suppose that QuickSort happens to always select the [%]-th largest element as its pivot. Give a recurrence relation for the runtime of QuickSort.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
