The inverse power method for computing an eigenvalue of a given matrix A computes iterates that are based on solving linear systems involving A — pI, where p is a constant which is desirably close to the eigenvalue we seek to compute. Assume that we have a computer pro- gram to set up and carry out the iterations, and suppose the iterative process has converged within k iterations. Assume that computational efficiency is a prime consideration, and we have performed computa- tions as efficiently as we could. (a) How many times (at a minimum) throughout the iterative process do we need to compute the LU decomposition of A — pI? (b) How many times do we need to perform backward and forward substitutions? (c) If the matrix is known to be tridiagonal of size nxn and n is large, and it is known that the inverse power iteration has converged within 10 iterations, what is the overall cost of the procedure? You may assume that with respect to the value of n, the number 10 is considered O(1).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
