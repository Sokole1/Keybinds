Consider the following diﬀerential equation: 2y3 + 3y2 dy dx = 0 (1) (a) 2 marks Show that the equation is not exact. Answer: My = 6y2 ̸= Nx = 0 Solution: We have M (x, y) = 2y3 ⇒ My = 6y2 N (x, y) = 3y2 ⇒ Nx = 0 Hence My ̸= Nx, the equation is not exact. (b) 4 marks Find an integrating factor µ(x) to make the equation exact and ﬁnd the solution to equation (1) in an implicit form. Note: the general equation satisﬁed by an integration factor µ(x, y) is M µy − N µx + (My − Nx)µ = 0. Answer: y3e 2x = C Solution: µ(x) satisﬁes: µx µ = My − Nx N = 6y2 − 0 3y2 = 2 such that µ(x) = e 2x. Multiplying by µ(x), the ODE becomes exact and reads: 2y3e2x + 3y2e2x dy dx = 0 We have Fx = M = 2y3e 2x and anti-diﬀerentiating we get F (x, y) = y3e 2x + h(y). Then Fy = 3y2e 2x + h ′(y) = N = 3y2e 2x, thus h ′(y) = 0 and we choose h(y) = 0, such that F (x, y) = y3e 2x and the implicit form of the solution is y3e 2x = C Page 3 of 12 (c) 4 marks Assuming y(x) ̸= 0, show that this ODE can be solved in a far simpler way as a separable equation and write the solution in an explicit form. Answer: y(x) = Ae −2x/3 Solution: We simplify by y3 and re-arrange the ODE as a separable ODE as follows: y′ y = −2 3 Anti-diﬀerentiating, we get: ln |y| = −2 3x + C Taking the exponential, we ﬁnally get: y = ±e Ce−2x/3 = Ae−2x/3 Page 4 of 12 (d) 3 marks (bonus) Find an integrating factor µ(y) to make the equation exact and ﬁnd the solution to equation (1) in an implicit form. Show that your ﬁnal answer can be witten in the exact same form as your answer to (b). Answer: y3e 2x = C Solution: µ(y) satisﬁes: µy µ = −My − Nx M = −6y2 − 0 2y3 = − 3 y such that µ(y) = 1 y3 . Multiplying by µ(y), the ODE becomes exact and reads: 2 + 3 y dy dx = 0 We have Fx = M = 2 and anti-diﬀerentiating we get F (x, y) = 2x + h(y). Then Fy = h ′(y) = N = 3/y, thus h ′(y) = 3/y and we choose h(y) = ln |y| 3, such that F (x, y) = 2x+ln|y| 3 and the implicit form of the solution is 2x + ln |y| 3 = ˜C However taking the logarithm of the previus equation gives: |y| 3e 2x = e ˜C ⇔ y3e 2x = ±e ˜C = C Page 5 of 12 2. Consider the following IVP: 2y′ − (y2 − 4) x 2 √ x2 − 9 = 0 , y(3) = 6 (a) 6 marks Find the solution y(x). Tip: Recall Partial Fraction Decom- position. Answer: y(x) = 2e√x2−9+4 2−e √x2−9 Solution: This is a separable equation that we rewrite 2 y′ (y2 − 4) = x 2 √ x2 − 9 We observe that y2 − 4 = (y + 2)(y − 2) and use partial fraction decomposition to rewrite the ODE as: 1 2 ( y′ y − 2 − y′ y + 2 ) = x 2 √x2 − 9 We simplify by 1/2 and anti-diﬀerentiate each side to get: ln |y − 2| − ln |y + 2| = √x2 − 9 + C ⇒ ln \f \f \f \f y − 2 y + 2 \f \f \f \f = √x2 − 9 + C Taking the exponential leads to: y − 2 y + 2 = ±eCe√x2−9 = Ae√x2−9 With the IC y(3) = 6, we ﬁnd C: 6−2 6+2 = Ae0, i.e. A = 1/2. Finally solving for y gives y(x) = 2e √x2−9 + 4 2 − e√x2−9 Page 6 of 12 (b) 2 marks Give the domain of existence of the solution y(x). Answer: [3, √ 9 + (ln 2)2) Solution: We need x2 − 9 ≥ 0 (2) 2 − e √x2−9 ̸= 0 (3) which gives x ≤ −3 ∪ x ≥ 3 (4) x ̸= ± √ 9 + (ln 2)2 (5) This interval that contains the IC is x ≥ 3, and is bounded by√ 9 + (ln 2)2 therefore the domain of existence is [3, √ 9 + (ln 2)2). Page 7 of 12 3. 16 marks Solve the following IVP: y′′ − 2y′ + y = 4ex + sin(3x) , y(0) = 0 , y′(0) = −15 50 Answer: y(x) = − 3 50e x + 2x2e x + 3 50 cos(3x) − 2 25 sin(3x) Solution: Step 1: Complementary solution yc(x) solves the homogeneous equation y′′−2y′+y = 0. The characteristic equation is r2 − 2r + 1 = 0, the determinant is ∆ = (−2)2 − 4 · 1 · 1 = 0. So the double root is r1,2 = 1 and the solution is of the form yc(x) = (C1 + C2x)ex. Step 2: Particular solution The right hand side can be written f0(x) + f1(x) with f0(x) = 4e x and f1(x) = sin(3x). yp0 is a solution of y′′ − 2y′ + y = f0(x) = 4ex. We guess yp0 = xsAex. Obvisouly, neither s = 0 nor s = 1 work as in both cases we recover a part of yc(x), hence we need to try s = 2, i.e., yp0 = Ax2ex. We calculate y′′ p0 − 2y′ p0 + yp0 = A(2e x + 4xex + x2ex − 4xex − 2x2ex + x2ex) = 2Aex = f0(x) = 4e x ⇒ A = 2 and yp0 = 2x2ex. yp1 is a solution of y′′ − 2y′ + y = f1(x) = sin(3x). We guess yp1 = xs(A cos(3x) + B sin(3x)), and we try s = 0. We calculate y′′ p1 − 2y′ p1 + yp1 = (−9A − 6B + A) cos(3x) + (−9B + 6A + B) sin(3x) = f1(x) = sin(3x) ⇒ −8A − 6B = 0 and − 8B + 6A = 1 Solving for A and B, we get A = 3 50 and B = − 2 25, and yp1 = 3 50 cos(3x) − 2 25 sin(3x). Step 3: General solution y(x) = yc(x) + yp0(x) + yp1(x) = (C1 + C2x)e x + 2x2e x + 3 50 cos(3x) − 2 25 sin(3x) Step 4: ICs We determine C1 and C2 with the two ICs. y(0) = 0 = C1 + 3 50 ⇒ C1 = − 3 50 Page 8 of 12 We derive the expression of y′(x) ﬁrst: y′(x) = C2e x + (C1 + C2x)e x + 4xex + 2x2e x − 9 50 sin(3x) − 6 25 cos(3x) Then we use y′(0) = − 15 50 as follows: y′(0) = C2 + C1 − 6 25 = −15 50 ⇒ C2 = 0 Finally, the solution to the IVP is y(x) = − 3 50e x + 2x2e x + 3 50 cos(3x) − 2 25 sin(3x) Page 9 of 12 4. Consider a mass-spring-damper system with a mass of m = 1 kg, a damping coeﬃcient c = 6 N · s · m −1 and a spring constant k = 18 N · m −1. A t = 0, the mass is released from a position x(0) = −1 m with an initial velocity x′(0) = 2 m · s−1. (a) 7 marks Formulate and solve the IVP, give the solution x(t). Answer: x(t) = −e −3t(cos(3t) + 1 3 sin(3t)) Solution: The IVP is x′′ + 6x′ + 18x = 0 , x(0) = −1 , x ′(0) = 2 The characteristic equation is r2 + 6r + 18 = 0 and the two complex roots are r1,2 = −3 ± 3i, such that the solution takes the following form x(t) = e −3t(A cos(3t) + B sin(3t)) x(0) = −1 gives A = −1. We ﬁrst derive the expression of x′(t) = −3x(t) + e −3t(−3A sin(3t) + 3B cos(3t)), and then use x′(0) = 2 = −3x(0) + 3B = 3 + 3B to get B = − 1 3. Finally, x(t) reads as follows x(t) = −e −3t(cos(3t) + 1 3 sin(3t)) Page 10 of 12 (b) 3 marks Write the solution x(t) in the form Ce αt cos(βt − γ). Answer: x(t) = √10 3 e −3t cos (3t − ( arctan ( 1 3) + π)) Solution: We ﬁnd C = √A2 + B2 = √10/3 and γ = arctan(1/3) + π since A < 0 and B < 0. Finally, we obtain x(t) = √10 3 e−3t cos (3t − ( arctan ( 1 3 ) + π)) Page 11 of 12 5. 6 marks Consider a mass-spring-damper system with a mass of m = 1 kg, a damping coeﬃcient c = 6 N · s · m −1 and a spring constant k = 9 N. · m−1. A t = 0, the mass is released from a position x(0) = 1m with an initial velocity x′(0) = V . Find the initial velocity V such that x(2) = 0. Answer: V = −3.5 m · s−1 Solution: The IVP is x′′ + 6x′ + 9x = 0 , x(0) = 1 , x ′(0) = V The characteristic equation is r2 + 6r + 9 = 0 and the double root is r1,2 = −3, such that the solution takes the following form x(t) = (C1 + C2t)e −3t x(0) = 1 gives C1 = 1. Now we establish the relationship between C2 and V . We ﬁrst derive the expression of x′(t) = C2e−3t − 3(1 + C2t)e−3t, and then use x′(0) = V = C2 − 3 such that C2 = V + 3. x(2) = 0 means 0 = 1 + 2C2 = 1 + 2V + 6, which gives V = −3.5 m · s−1.
