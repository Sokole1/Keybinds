Consider the diﬀerential equation y′′ + 2y′ + 5y = 10t. (a) Find the general solution. (b) Describe the behavior of the solution when t is large for any initial condition. Answer. (a) A particular solution has the form yp = At + B. Pluggin this in to the equation we get 2A + 5(At + B) = 10t, so A = 2 and B = − 4 5 . The homogeneous equation has characteristic equation λ2 + 2λ + 5 = 0, which has roots λ = − 2 ± √4 − 20 2 = −1 ± 2i. Thus the general soution is y = C1e−t cos(2t) + C2e−t sin(2t) + 2t − 4 5 . (b) When t is large the solution looks like the particular solution yp = 2t − 4 5 , because the homogeneous part of the solution decays. That is lim t→∞ y − yp = 0. 2. Consider the undamped spring equation y′′ + cy = sin(2t). (a) For what value of c does resonance occur? Compute the solution at resonance with y(0) = 1 and y′(0) = 0. (b) For what values of c is there a beat with frequency 0.1 Hz? (The beat frequency is deﬁned as |µ−ω| 2 rad/s where µ is the natural frequency of the spring and ω is the forcing frequency.) Answer. 1 (a) Resonance occurs when c = 4, so that µ = 2 is the natural frequency of the spring. The particular solution has form yp = At cos(2t) + Bt sin(2t). y′ p = −2At sin(2t) + A cos(2t) + 2Bt cos(wt) + B sin(2t), and y′′ p = −4At cos(2t) − 4A sin(2t) − 4Bt sin(2t) + 4B cos(2t). Pluggin this in we ﬁnd B = 0 and A = −1 4 . The general solution is y = C1 cos(2t) + C2 sin(2t) − 1 4 t cos(2t). We have C1 = 1, and 0 = y′(0) = −2C1 sin(2(0)) + 2C2 cos(2(0)) − 1 4 cos(2(0)) + 1 2 (0) sin(2(0)) = 2C2 − 1 4 . So C2 = 1 8 . The solution is y = cos(2t) + 1 8 sin(2t) − 1 4 t cos(2t). (b) The beat frequency is given by |√c − 2| 2 = 0.1(2π) so √c − 2 = ±0.2(2π) or c = (2 ± 0.2(2π))2, which is about c = 10.6 or c = 0.55. 3. Find the domain of the Laplace transform and evaluate using the integral F (s) = ∫ ∞ 0 e−stf (t)dt for each of the following: (a) f (t) = (t + 1)e−4t. (b) f (t) = e−3t sin(t). You must show all your work to receive credit. Answer. (a) The Laplace transform is given by the improper integral F (s) = ∫ ∞ 0 (t + 1)e−4te −stdt = ∫ ∞ 0 (t + 1)e(−4−s)tdt. The domain requires that −4 − s < 0, i.e. s > −4. 2 Integrate by parts letting u = (t + 1) and dv = e(−4−s)t, so that du = dt and v = 1 −4−s e(−4−s)t and F (s) = t + 1 (−4 − s) e(−4−s)t\f \f \f ∞ t=0 − ∫ ∞ 0 1 −4 − s e(−4−s)tdt = 1 4 + s − 1 (4 + s)2 e (−4−s)t\f \f \f ∞ t=0 = 1 4 + s + 1 (4 + s)2 . The domain is s > −4. (b) F (s) = ∫ ∞ 0 e−ste−3t sin(t)dt = ∫ ∞ 0 e(−3−s)t sin(t)dt. The domain requires that −3−s < 0 so s > −3. Then we integrate by parts with u = sin(t) and dv = e(−3−s)t, so v = −1 3+s e(−3−s)t, F (s) = sin(t) −1 3 + s e(−3−s)t\f \f \f∞ t=0 − ∫ ∞ 0 cos(t) −1 3 + s e(−3−s)tdt = 1 3 + s ∫ ∞ 0 cos(t)e(−3−s)tdt. We integrate by parts again with u = cos(t) and dv = e(−3−s)t F (s) = − 1 (3 + s)2 cos(t)e(−3−s)t\f \f \f∞ t=0 − 1 3 + s ∫ ∞ 0 ( − sin(t) −1 3 + s e(−3−s)t)dt = 1 (3 + s)2 − 1 (3 + s)2 F (s). Solving for F (s) we get ( (3 + s)2 + 1 (3 + s)2 )F (s) = 1 (3 + s)2 so F (s) = 1 (3 + s)2 + 1 with domain s > −3, 3 MATH 215/255 Homework 5M Submit online via Canvas by 6pm, Wednesday, October 23, 2019 M1. Consider a damped forced system mu ′′ + cu ′ + ku = F0 cos(ωt) where ω is the forcing frequency. Using analytical methods, we ﬁnd the steady state response of the system is uss(t) = F0 m√ (2ωp)2 + (ω2 0 − ω2)2 cos(ωt − γ) where p = c 2m , ω0 = √ k m , γ = arctan ( 2ωp ω2 0 − ω2 ) (a) Let m = 4, c = 1, k = 8 and F0 = 8.
