Use the Taylor expansions of 𝑢 to find the finite difference approximations for the derivatives in this equation and find a discrete form of the advection-diffusion equation. Answer: Approximate 𝑢 𝑡 with forward difference. Approximate 𝑢 𝑥 with central difference. Approximate 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 with second order central difference. Substituting into the original equation we get: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 ) − 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) Δ 𝑡 + 𝑐 𝑢 ( 𝑥 + Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) − 𝑢 ( 𝑥 − Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) 2 Δ 𝑥 = 𝐷 𝑢 ( 𝑥 + Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) − 2 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) + 𝑢 ( 𝑥 − Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) Δ 𝑥 2 + 𝑂 ( Δ 𝑡 , Δ 𝑥 2 ) Find discrete values with 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 = 𝑢 ( 𝑥 𝑛 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) where we have 𝑁 + 1 points evenly spaced by Δ 𝑥 from 𝑛 = 0 , 1 , … , 𝑁 where 𝑥 𝑛 = 𝑛 Δ 𝑥 , and 𝑀 + 1 evenly spaced time levels from 𝑘 = 0 , 1 , … , 𝑀 where 𝑡 𝑘 = 𝑘 Δ 𝑡 . Now using in our formula we get: 𝑢 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 − 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 Δ 𝑡 + 𝑐 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 2 Δ 𝑥 = 𝐷 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 Δ 𝑥 2 Rearranging we get: 𝑢 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 = 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + Δ 𝑡 2 Δ 𝑥 2 ( 2 𝐷 ( 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 ) − 𝑐 Δ 𝑥 ( 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 ) ) 2. Explain how you would advance the solution in time to find 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 ) at each time step and discuss the order of accuracy of your numerical scheme in time and space. Answer: We start with 𝑘 = 0 , assuming we have an initial condition for the first time step. We write out the formula for each time step. Then if we have 2 initial conditions given for space, we will be able to solve the system of equations for each time step equation. Forward difference approximation for time 𝑢 𝑡 is first order accurate. For space, central difference approximation of 𝑢 𝑥 is second order accurate. Second derivative central difference approximation for 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 is also second order accurate. 1 William Kang Mathematics 257/316 Homework 4 77253938 Question 2Consider the PDE for the wave equation with damping 𝑢 𝑡 𝑡 + 𝑘 𝑢 𝑥 = 𝑐 2 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 (2) 1. Use the Taylor expansions of 𝑢 to find the finite difference approximations for the derivatives in this equation and find a discrete form of this equation Answer: Approximate 𝑢 𝑡 𝑡 with second order central difference. Approximate 𝑢 𝑥 with central difference. Approximate 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 with second order central difference. Substituting into the original equation we get: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 ) − 2 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) + 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 − Δ 𝑡 ) Δ 𝑡 2 + 𝑘 𝑢 ( 𝑥 + Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) − 𝑢 ( 𝑥 − Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) 2 Δ 𝑥 = 𝑐 2 𝑢 ( 𝑥 + Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) − 2 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) + 𝑢 ( 𝑥 − Δ 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) Δ 𝑥 2 + 𝑂 ( Δ 𝑡 2 , Δ 𝑥 2 ) Find discrete values with 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 = 𝑢 ( 𝑥 𝑛 , 𝑡 𝑘 ) where we have 𝑁 + 1 points evenly spaced by Δ 𝑥 from 𝑛 = 0 , 1 , … , 𝑁 where 𝑥 𝑛 = 𝑛 Δ 𝑥 , and 𝑀 + 1 evenly spaced time levels from 𝑘 = 0 , 1 , … , 𝑀 where 𝑡 𝑘 = 𝑘 Δ 𝑡 . Now using in our formula we get: 𝑢 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 − 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 𝑢 𝑘 − 1 𝑛 Δ 𝑡 2 + 𝑘 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 2 Δ 𝑥 = 𝑐 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 Δ 𝑥 2 Rearranging we get: 𝑢 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 = 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 𝑢 𝑘 − 1 𝑛 + Δ 𝑡 2 2 Δ 𝑥 2 ( 2 𝑐 2 ( 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 2 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 ) − 𝑘 Δ 𝑥 ( 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 + 1 − 𝑢 𝑘𝑛 − 1 ) ) 2. Explain how you would advance the solution in time to find 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 + Δ 𝑡 ) at each time step and discuss the order of accuracy of your numerical scheme in time and space Answer: Since we rely on have the two previous time steps to find 𝑢 𝑘 + 1 𝑛 , we need two initial conditions for time. We will also need two initial conditions for space. Then we can compute the next step. Second derivative central difference approximation for time 𝑢 𝑡 𝑡 is second order accurate. For space, central difference approximation of 𝑢 𝑥 is second order accurate. Second derivative central difference approximation for 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 is also second order accurate. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
