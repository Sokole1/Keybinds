Which nodes at level two of the above recursion tree are leaves, that is, have no children (corresponding to further recursive calls) at level three? Assume that we draw recursion trees with the first recursive call on the left. 4. Give an upper bound on the number of internal nodes of the recursion tree on input n. 5. Give a big-O upper bound on the number of leaves of the recursion tree on input n. 6. Using the work done so far, give a big-O bound on the run-time of algorithm MEMO-CHANGE(n).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
