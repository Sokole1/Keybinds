There we saw a numerically unstable procedure for carrying out the given task. (a) Derive a formula for approximately computing these integrals based on evaluating Yn—1 given yn. (b) Show that for any given value ¢ > 0 and positive integer no, there exists an in- teger ny > ny such that taking y,,, = 0 as a starting value will produce integral evaluations ,, with an absolute error smaller than for all 0 < n. < nq. (c) Explain why your algorithm is stable. (d) Write a function that computes the value of y2o within an absolute error of at most 1077, Explain how you choose n1 in this case.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
