UBC Rec student leaders are planning their next fundraiser, and are seeking your help in identifying strategic locations to set up their stands of Krispy Kremes. They have a map showing n locations of buildings and outdoor spots on campus. Their k stands need to be set up in the outdoor spots. They want you to select k spots such that the maximum distance from any of the n locations to a stand is as small as possible. An instance of the Strategically Placed Krispy Kremes decision problem (SPKK) has a set V' of size n, a subset S of V, an integer k, 1 < k < |S|, and a symmetric matrix d[1..n][1..n], plus an additional nonnegative integer b. The problem is to determine if there is a subset S’ C S of size k, such that in{d| \"} < b. max min{dv][s] | s € §'} < 1. (8 marks) Choose an NP-complete problem from those you've already seen, and show a re- duction from this problem to SPKK. Briefly justify why the reduction is polynomial-time (one sentence is sufficient). Carefully explain why your reduction is correct (two paragraphs is sufficient).","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
