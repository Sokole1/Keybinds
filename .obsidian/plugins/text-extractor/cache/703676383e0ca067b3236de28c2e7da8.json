Let f, g be smooth scalar functions on R 3 and ⃗F be a smooth vector ﬁeld on R 3. Find the condition on ∇f and ∇g so that ∇ × (g∇f ) = ⃗0. Specify vector identities that you are using, but you are not required to justify them. 5. Let S be the surface z = 2 + x2 − 3y2 and F = (xz + axy2, yz, z2). Consider the points P1 = (1, 1, 0) and P2 = (0, 0, 2) on the surface S. Find a value of the constant a so that∫ C1 F · dr = ∫ C2 F · dr for any two curves C1 and C2 on the surface S from P1 to P2. 6. Let C be the intersection of the paraboloid z = x2 + y2 and the plane z = 2y + 3 oriented counterclockwise when observed from the point (0, 0, 100). Compute the line integral ∮ C ⃗F · d⃗r for the vector ﬁeld ⃗F = ⟨−y3, x 3, −z3⟩. 7. Let S be the portion of the ellipsoid x2 + 4y2 + z2 = 4 where z ≥ √3x. Suppose that S is oriented so that the unit normal vector at (0, 0, 2) is ⟨0, 0, 1⟩. Let ⃗F be a vector ﬁeld such that ∇ × ⃗F = ⟨− √ 3y2, −2zy, z2⟩. Use Stokes’ theorem to compute ∫∫ S(∇ × ⃗F ) · ˆndS. 8. Let f (t) be a function of 1-variable, and g(x, y, z) a function of 3-variables. Suppose we know g(1, 2, 3) = 4, ∇g(1, 2, 3) = (1, 0, 1), ∇2g(1, 2, 3) = 2. and f (4) = 1, f ′(4) = 2, f ′′(4) = 3. Let h(x, y, z) = f (g(x, y, z)) and evaluate ∇ 2h at the point (1, 2, 3).
