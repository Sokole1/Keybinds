FedEx has a fleet of 654 aircraft with a lift capacity of 26.5 million pounds daily. A solid-state laptop drive weighs about 78 grams and can hold up to a terabyte. That means FedEx is capable of transferring 150 exabytes of data per day, or 14 petabits per second—almost a hundred times the current throughput of the internet. CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Network Performance Maryam R.Aliabadi SUV vs Fiber The distance of 413km from UBC-V to UBC-O can be covered at an average speed of 75km/hr in an SUV with 3.5m³ of carrying capacity. A Blu-Ray in a jewel case takes up 88.75 cm³. There is a 100 Gbit/s data connection between the two institutions. You have 260,000 GBytes of data, currently stored on Blu-Ray discs that you want to get to UBC-O and store on disk there. Each disc, on average, has 40 GBytes of data. 9CPSC 317 – Computer Networking : Network Performance Maryam R.Aliabadi Clicker question Which will get the data to Kelowna faster? 413km, 75km/hr, 100 Gbit/s network, 260000 GBytes A.

The network operates at a data rate of 8 Mbps (Megabits per second). The total transmission time for the file is 12 seconds. During the transmission, 1 MB of the data consists of protocol overhead (headers, acknowledgments, retransmissions, etc.) is also sent.
