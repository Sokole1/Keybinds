Numerical Algorithms (a) Find an instance in this floating point system that illustrates the numerical difficulty discussed in Example 1.6, when a ~ b. (b) In that Example, we made the following statement: “... the two equations represent lines in R? that are nearly parallel to each other, and this in turn generates a high level of sensitivity.” Explain this statement in quantitative terms and give a specific geometric instance that supports your explanation. (c) Suppose that instead of computing = and y, we are tasked with computing the sum z+y for a sequence of values of the parameters a and b. Devise a numerically stable algorithm for carrying out this task.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
