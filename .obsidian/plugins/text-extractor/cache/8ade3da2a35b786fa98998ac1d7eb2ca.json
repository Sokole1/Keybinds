So, at any point along the curve, these vectors are parallel. Furthermore, we know that ¢ and s are positively correlated: as ¢ increases, so does s, because we're covering more arclength. So, % is nonnegative. Furthermore, since the derivatives are nonzero, % is nonzero. So, b’(s¢) and a’(to) are positive scalar multiples of each other. That is, they are parallel, and pointing in the same direction. However, unless % =1(thatis, t(s) =s+C for some constant C), the vectors do not have the same magnitude, and hence are not equal. So, A is the best solution. We consider the situation geometrically. If we plot R in space (of the relevant dimension), regardless of its parametrization, the derivative at a point will give a vector tangent to R, in the direction the curve moves when the parameter is increasing. Since a(to) and b(sg) describe the same spot on the curve, a’(to) and b/(so) will be parallel! — they're both tangent to the same piece of curve. Furthermore, as t increases, so does s, so the direction of increasing t is the same as the direction of increasing s. Therefore, A. holds. tangent direction a(to) = b(so) R Now we consider the magnitudes of the vectors, to rule out E. Recall |a’(t)| is the speed at which the curve changes relative to ¢; this could be any (nonnegative) number. By the same token, |b’(s)| = 1. So, b/(so) is a unit vector, while a’(tg) may or may not be. Then the two vectors are not necessarily equal (although they could be). So, the best answer is A.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
