Suppose you only have your mobile phone without Internet connection, and you need to approximately compute the cube root of a number b > 0, that is, you need to approximately compute o= This means that you need to find a number z such that z* = b. Your mobile phone has a calculator with the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), but no fancy op- erations such as cube root. (a) Suggest an iterative procedure based on Newton’s method that will allow you to compute such an approximation, using your phone’s calculator. You may assume that you have a pretty good initial guess close to the number you are trying to compute. (b) Suppose (perhaps fictionally) that your calculator happens to have a double precision floating point system (with machine round- ing unit of approximately 1071%), but the screen displays only eight decimal digits. If the initial guess is correct to one decimal digit, i.e., the initial error is approximately 0.1, within how many iterations do you expect to converge to a result that would be seen as correct or nearly correct on the screen of your phone’s calculator? (c) If you have done everything correctly, you should be quite satis- fied with your procedure. Alas, to further check your work you tried to see what happens when you extend your procedure to compute z = /0 (the answer of which is 0) with an initial guess 2o = 0.1 and you found out that convergence is much slower than you have observed for a set of positive numbers you have previously tested. Explain why this is so.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
