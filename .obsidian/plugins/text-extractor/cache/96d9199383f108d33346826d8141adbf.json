Use the SVD to show that || A||2 = ||G||3. (b) Use the above to determine the relationship between the condition number of A and that of G. (c) Explain why this provides an argument for concluding that the Cholesky decompo- sition does not require pivoting to be stable.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
