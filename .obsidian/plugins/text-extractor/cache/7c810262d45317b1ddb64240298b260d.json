Let's correct the proof using the given property ¢|(a -+ b). i Given, 0 (a,b) =1 @el(a+b) We need to show: O(c,a)=1 @ (e,b) =1 Prooffor (c,a) = 1: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that (¢, a) # 1. Then there exists a prime p such that pleandpla. From c|(a + b), we have p|(a -+ b). But since p|a, it follows that p|b. This contradicts the given (a, b) = 1 because a prime p divides both a and b. ‘Thus, our assumption was incorrect, so (¢, a) = 1. Prooffor (c,b) = 1 Similarly, suppose for the sake of contradiction that (¢, b) # 1. Then there exists a prime p such that plc and plb. From c|(a + b), we have p|(a -+ b). But since p|b, it follows that p|a. Again, this contradicts the given (a, b) = 1 because a prime p divides both a and b Thus, our assumption was incorrect, 5o (¢, b) = 1. Hence, i, b, and c are integers such that (a,b) = 1 and c|(a + b), then (c, a) = 1 and () =1","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
