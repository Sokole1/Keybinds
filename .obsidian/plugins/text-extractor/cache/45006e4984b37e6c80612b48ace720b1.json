Let A+ 6A and b + 6b be perturbation of a matrix A and a vector b (b # 0), respectively, and let x and dx be such that Ax = b and (A +54)(x +6x) = b + b, where 4 is a given nonsingular matrix. Note: the notation dx, db, and 6A refers here to two completely different vectors and a matrix, respectively, not to a multiplication of the original vectors and matrix by a scalar 5. We assume that 124l < 1 and [ < 1, that is iginal vectors and matrix by a scalar ยง. We assume that 7 < 1 and gy < 1, that is, the perturbations of the matrix and the right-hand side vector are very small. We further assume that these perturbations are so small that the second-order term 64 - ยงx, obtained upon expanding the expression on the left-hand side of the displayed equation, can be ignored.
