In the case F ≡ 0 we know that a solution is of the form ∞∑ n=1 bn sin ( nπx L ) e −n2π2kt/L2, in which the bn are the coeﬃcients in the Fourier sine expansion of f on [0, L]. For the non-homogeneous problem, we will take a cue from that case and attempt a solution u(x, t) = ∞∑ n=1 Tn(t) sin ( nπx L ) . (2) The problem is to determine each Tn(t). 1. By observing that, for a given t, equation (2) can be interpreted as the Fourier sine expansion of u(x, t), considered as a function of x, with Tn(t) being the nth Fourier coeﬃcient in this expansion, carefully establish the expression for Tn(t). 2. Now assume that for each t ≥ 0, F (x, t), as a function of x, can also be expanded in a Fourier sine series: F (x, t) = ∞∑ n=1 Bn(t) sin (nπx L ) dx (3) where Bn(t) = 2 L ∫ L 0 F (ξ, t) sin ( nπξ L ) dξ (4) is the coeﬃcient in this expansion, and may depend on t. Determine and solve the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by Tn(t) for all n = 1, 2, . . . 3. Deduce the solution of (1). Question 2 (submit) Applying the result form Question 1, solve the following partial diﬀerential equation:  |||| |||| ut = 4uxx + t 2 cos(x/2), 0 < x < π, t > 0, u(0, t) = u(π, t) = 0, t ≥ 0, u(x, 0) = { 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2, 25, π/2 < x < π.

Problem 3 (Do not submit) - Heat equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions Consider the following boundary value problem for the heat equation governing the temperature within a conducting bar: ut = uxx, 0 < x < 1, t > 0, BC : ux(0, t) = 1, u(1, t) = 0, IC : u(x, 0) = 0. (7) (a) Determine the steady-state temperature u∞(x). (b) Let u(x, t) = u∞(x)+v(x, t) and identify the PDE, BC, and IC satisﬁed by v(x, t). (c) Use the method of separation of variables to solve the above boundary value problem for v(x, t) and from this determine the solution u(x, t). Problem 4 (Do not submit) - Heat equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions Solve the following heat conduction problem with heat loss and a distributed heat source: ut = uxx − u + x, 0 < x < 1, t > 0, BC : ux(0, t) = 1, ux(1, t) = 2, IC : u(x, 0) = x. (8) 2 Hint: First, try to ﬁnd a steady-state solution that satisﬁes the PDE and the inhomo- geneous boundary conditions. Next, let u(x, t) = u∞(x) + v(x, t) and identify the PDE, BC, and IC satisﬁed by v(x, t). It may be helpful to know the following integral formula: ∫ cos(Ax) cosh(Bx) dx = B cos(Ax) sinh(Bx) + A sin(Ax) cosh(Bx) A2 + B2 .
