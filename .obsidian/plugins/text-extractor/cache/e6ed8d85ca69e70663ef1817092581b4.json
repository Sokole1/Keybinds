Run your program for a = 2 and a = 10. For each of these cases, start with an initial guess of your choice, reasonably close to the solution. (A reasonably close initial guess may be, for example, o = 1 for a = 2 and zp = 2 for a = 10.) As a stopping criterion, require the absolute function value to be smaller than 10~1°. Print out the values of z, and |f(zx)| in each iteration. Answer:","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
