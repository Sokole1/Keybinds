Based on the second data set, can you reject the same hypothesis?Answer: Based on the first data set we cannot because ùúá = 1 is contained in the 9 5 % confidence interval. But we can reject the hypothesis for the second data set since ùúá = 1 is outside the confidence interval. 3d) 3e) Suppose that ùúá = 1 exactly, and that 100 investigators perform the same test. What is the expected number of tests that will reject the hypothesis that ùúá = 1 at the 5 % level? What does this tell you about the trustworthiness of such hypothesis tests?Answer: With 95% confidence level, we can expect about 5% to fall outside of our confidence interval. So this would be 5 investigators. This tells us that the hypothesis tests should not be interpreted as a guarantee for an event, and rather a measure of how likely our result is. 3 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 7 77253938 Question 4 4 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 7 77253938 5 William Kang Mathematics 318 Homework 7 77253938 Question 5 6","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
