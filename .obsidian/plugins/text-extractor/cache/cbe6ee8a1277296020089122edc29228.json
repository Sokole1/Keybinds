The left end of the rod is also perfectly insulated, meaning no heat escapes or enters at 𝑥 = 0 . Meanwhile, the right end at 𝑥 = 𝐿 loses thermal energy at a rate proportional to its temperature at that point. The initial temperature distribution along the rod is given by the function 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) . The problem is stated as follows: 𝑢 𝑡 = 𝛼 2 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 , 0 < 𝑥 < 𝐿 , 𝑡 > 0 𝑢 𝑥 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 , 𝑢 𝑥 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) + 𝜅 𝑢 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 0 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) Where 𝜅 > 0 . Use the method of separation of variables to solve the problem. Answer: Assume solution is of the form 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) . Differentiate both sides: 𝑢 𝑡 = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) Then substituting into the original to get: 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝛼 2 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) ⋅ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) Dividing by 𝛼 2 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) : ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝛼 2 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 for some constant 𝜆 since both sides depend on different variables, they must equal a constant. Solve for time : ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝛼 2 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜆 ̇𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝜆 𝛼 2 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) . Solving gives: 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑒 𝜆 𝛼 2 𝑡 for some constant 𝐶 Solve space equation : 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) . Given initial conditions: 𝑋 ( 0 ) = 0 = 𝑋 ( 𝐿 ) . 𝑋 = 0 is a trivial solution. Find nontrivial solution which depends on 𝜆 . Case 1. 𝜆 > 0 . Let 𝜆 = 𝜇 2 so: 𝑋 ″ − 𝜇 2 𝑋 = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 sinh ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) + 𝐵 cosh ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝜇 cosh ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) + 𝐵 𝜇 sinh ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) Now we apply the initial condition: 𝑢 𝑥 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ′ ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 [ 𝐴 𝜇 cosh ( 0 ) + 𝐵 𝜇 sinh ( 0 ) ] 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so 𝐴 𝜇 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 Since 𝜆 > 0 we must have 𝐴 = 0 so 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐵 cosh ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) , 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐵 𝜇 sinh ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) Now we have the initial condition 𝑢 𝑥 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) + 𝜅 𝜇 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 0 𝐵 𝜇 sinh ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝜅 𝐵 cosh ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 1 William Kang Mathematics 257/316 Homework 5 77253938 Assuming 𝐵 ≠ 0 we need: 𝜇 sinh ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = − 𝜅 cosh ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) ⇒ tanh ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = − 𝜅 𝜇 But since 𝐿 > 0 and 𝜅 > 0 . If we have 𝜇 > 0 then the left side will be positive while the right side will be negative. Similarly if 𝜇 < 0 the left side will be negative while the right side positive. Therefore they cannot be equal which is a contradiction so our assumption that 𝐵 ≠ 0 was incorrect. There are only trivial solutions where 𝐴 = 0 and 𝐵 = 0 Case 2. 𝜆 = 0 . This simplifies the equation to: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑥 + 𝐵 . Applying the initial conditions: 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑢 𝑥 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ′ ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so 𝐴 = 0 Now apply initial condition: 𝑢 𝑥 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) + 𝜅 𝜇 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 0 0 + 𝜅 𝐵 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 . Since 𝜅 > 0 we must have 𝐵 > 0 which is another trivial solution. Case 3. 𝜆 < 0 . Let 𝜆 = − 𝜇 2 so: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) + 𝜇 2 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) + 𝐵 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝜇 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) − 𝐵 𝜇 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) Apply the initial condition 𝑢 𝑥 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝑋 ′ ( 0 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 𝜇 = 0 . Since 𝜇 ≠ 0 , we have 𝐴 = 0 . So: 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐵 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) , 𝑋 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = − 𝐵 𝜇 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) Apply the initial condition 𝑢 𝑥 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) + 𝜅 𝜇 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 0 − 𝐵 𝜇 sin ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) + 𝜅 𝐵 cos ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 Therefore we need: 𝜅 𝐵 cosh ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = 𝐵 𝜇 sin ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) ⇒ tan ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = 𝜅 𝜇 Assume there are infinite increasing solutions 𝜇 𝑛 : tan ( 𝜇 𝑘 𝐿 ) = 𝜅 𝜇 𝑘 , 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , … 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐵 𝑘 cos ( 𝜇 𝑘 𝑥 ) . This leads to infinite solutions, we can add them up using superposition principle 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑘 = 1 𝐵 𝑘 cos ( 𝜇 𝑘 𝑥 ) 𝑒 𝜇 2𝑘 𝛼 2 𝑡 (1) Now apply initial condition: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑘 = 1 𝐵 𝑘 cos ( 𝜇 𝑘 𝑥 ) (2) This is a Fourier cos series of 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) . Solve to find 𝐵 𝑘 . 2 William Kang Mathematics 257/316 Homework 5 77253938 Question 2Let 𝑐 , 𝐿 > 0 and let 𝑓 , 𝑔 : [ 0 , 𝐿 ] → ℝ be functions of class 𝐶 3 , satisfying the boundary conditions 𝑓 ( 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝐿 ) = 0 and 𝑔 ( 0 ) = 𝑔 ( 𝐿 ) = 0 . We seek to find 𝑢 = 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) , a solution to the wave equation: {{{{{{{ 𝑢 𝑡 𝑡 = 𝑐 2 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 , 𝑥 ∈ ( 0 , 𝐿 ) , 𝑡 > 0 𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑢 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 0 , 𝑡 > 0 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑥 ∈ ( 0 , 𝐿 ) 𝑢 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑔 ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑥 ∈ ( 0 , 𝐿 ) (3) 1. Show that the solution of the problem in the form 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) , ignoring the initial conditions 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) and 𝑢 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑔 ( 𝑥 ) , is given by: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 [ 𝑎 𝑛 cos ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) + 𝑏 𝑛 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) ] sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝐿 𝑥 ) (4) Answer: 𝑢 𝑥 𝑥 = 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑢 𝑡 𝑡 = 𝑇 ″ ( 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) Substituting into the original:𝑇 ″ ( 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑐 2 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ″ ( 𝑡 ) 𝑐 2 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝜆 for some constant 𝜆 since they are functions of different variables. So we must solve: 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) − 𝜆 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 0 and 𝑇 ″ ( 𝑡 ) − 𝑐 2 𝜆 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 . Case 1: 𝜆 = 0 : 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) = 0 and 𝑇 ″ ( 𝑡 ) = 0 . Both are of the form: 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑥 + 𝑏 , 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑡 + 𝑑 . But this solution diverges as lim 𝑡 → ∞ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = ∞ Case 2: 𝜆 > 0 : Assume solutions of the form: 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑒 𝑟 𝑥 , 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑒 𝑠 𝑡 Characteristic equations:𝑟 2 − 𝜆 = 0 ⇒ 𝑟 = ± √ 𝜆 𝑠 2 − 𝜆 𝑐 2 = 0 ⇒ 𝑠 = ± 𝑐 √ 𝜆 So 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 𝑒 √ 𝜆 𝑥 + 𝐵 𝑒 − √ 𝜆 𝑥 , 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 𝑒 𝑐 √ 𝜆 𝑡 + 𝐷 𝑒 − 𝑐 √ 𝜆 𝑡 . This solution also diverges as lim 𝑡 → ∞ 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = ∞ Case 3: 𝜆 < 0 Let 𝜆 = − 𝜇 2 : 𝑋 ″ ( 𝑥 ) + 𝜇 2 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 0 𝑇 ″ ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑐 2 𝜇 2 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 So the solutions are:𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐴 cos ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) + 𝐵 sin ( 𝜇 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 cos ( 𝑐 𝜇 𝑡 ) + 𝐷 sin ( 𝑐 𝜇 𝑡 ) Use initial condition 𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑢 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 0 𝑢 ( 0 , 𝑡 ) = ( 𝐴 cos ( 0 ) + 𝐵 sin ( 0 ) ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐴 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 so we must have 𝐴 = 0 3 William Kang Mathematics 257/316 Homework 5 77253938 𝑢 ( 𝐿 , 𝑡 ) = 𝐵 sin ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 0 ⇒ 𝐵 sin ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = 0 . We don’t want trivial case where 𝐵 = 0 so we need sin ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = 0 sin ( 𝜇 𝐿 ) = 0 when 𝜇 𝐿 = 𝑛 𝜋 , 𝑛 = 1 , 2 , … ⇒ 𝜇 = 𝑛 𝜋 𝐿 So 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐵 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝐿 𝑥 ) for 𝑛 = 1 , 2 , … Now plugging into 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) : 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 cos ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) + 𝐷 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) for 𝑛 = 1 , 2 , … . Now we can combine: 𝑢 𝑛 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 𝑛 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 𝑛 ( 𝑡 ) ⇒ ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 ( 𝑎 𝑛 cos ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) + 𝑏 𝑛 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) ) sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝐿 𝑥 ) (5) Here we distributed the constant 𝐵 and renamed and added the index 𝐶 𝐵 and 𝐷 𝐵 into 𝑎 𝑛 , 𝑏 𝑛 . 2. Determine the constants 𝑎 𝑛 and 𝑏 𝑛 by applying the initial conditions 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) and 𝑢 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑔 ( 𝑥 ) ; Deduce the general solution of the problem. Answer:𝑇 ′ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑐 𝜇 [ − 𝐶 sin ( 𝑐 𝜇 𝑡 ) + 𝐷 cos ( 𝑐 𝜇 𝑡 ) ] 𝑢 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ′ ( 0 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑐 𝜇 𝐷 . Since 𝑐 , 𝜇 > 0 we must have 𝐷 = 0 so: 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐶 cos ( 𝑐 𝜇 𝑡 ) . So plugging back into (5) we get: 𝑢 ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝑋 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑇 ( 𝑡 ) = ∑ ∞ 𝑛 = 1 𝑎 𝑛 cos ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝑐 𝐿 𝑡 ) sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝐿 𝑥 ) (6) 𝑢 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 0 ) = 𝑔 ( 𝑥 ) = ∑ ∞𝑛 = 1 𝑎 𝑛 sin ( 𝑛 𝜋 𝐿 𝑥 ) This is a Fourier sin series of 𝑔 ( 𝑥 ) . From the class notes the coefficients are: 𝑎 𝑚 = 1 𝐿 ∫ 𝐿 − 𝐿 𝑔 ( 𝑥 ) sin ( 𝑚 𝜋 𝑥 𝐿 ) 𝑑 𝑥 , 𝑚 = 1 , 2 , … 3.
