For each of the following instances, one of these methods has a distinct advantage over the other two. Match problems and methods and justify briefly. (a) f(z) = =z — 1 on the interval [0, 2.5]. (b) f(z) is given in Figure 2.9 on [0, 4]. (c) f € C5[0.1,0.2], the derivatives of f are all bounded in magnitude by 1, and f’(z) is hard to specify explicitly or evaluate.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
