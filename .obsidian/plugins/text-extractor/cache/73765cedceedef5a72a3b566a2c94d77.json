Answer. a). Let ⃗x(t) = [ x1(t) x2(t) ] and A = [ 2 0 0 3 ] , then ⃗x′ = A⃗x. Let’s ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A, that is, we should solve det (A − λI2) = det [ 2 − λ 0 0 3 − λ ] = 0, then λ1 = 2, and λ2 = 3. For λ1 = 2, let’s solve A⃗x = 2⃗x, that is, [ 0 0 0 1 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Then [ x1 x2 ] = x1 [ 1 0 ], that is, [ 1 0 ] is an eigenvalue for 2. For λ2 = 3, let’s solve A⃗x = 3⃗x, that is, [ −1 0 0 0 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Then [ x1 x2 ] = x2 [ 0 1 ], that is, [ 0 1 ] is an eigenvalue for 3. Therefore, the general solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x is: ⃗x(t) = C1e 2t [ 1 0 ] + C2e 3t [ 0 1 ] = [ C1e2t C2e3t ] . b). Since x′ 1 = 2x1, then x1 = C1e2t. Since x′ 2 = 3x2, then x2 = C2e3t. Hence the general soluton to ⃗x′ = A⃗x is: ⃗x(t) = [ C1e2t C2e3t ] . • 3.4.7: Find the general solution of x′ 1 = 3x1 + x2, x′ 2 = 2x1 + 4x2 using the eigenvalue method. Answer. Let ⃗x(t) = [ x1(t) x2(t) ] and A = [ 3 1 2 4 ], then ⃗x′ = A⃗x. Let’s ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A, that is, we should solve det (A − λI2) = det [ 3 − λ 1 2 4 − λ ] = 0, then (λ − 3)(λ − 4) − 2 = 0, that is, λ2 − 7λ + 10 = 0, which implies that λ1 = 2, and λ2 = 5. For λ1 = 2, let’s solve A⃗x = 2⃗x, that is, [ 1 1 2 2 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Then [ x1 x2 ] = x1 [ 1 −1 ] , that is, [ 1 −1 ] is an eigenvalue for 2. For λ2 = 5, let’s solve A⃗x = 5⃗x, that is, [ −2 1 2 −1 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Then [ x1 x2 ] = x1 [ 1 2 ] , that is, [ 1 2 ] is an eigenvalue for 3. Therefore, the general solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x is: ⃗x(t) = C1e2t [ 1 −1 ] + C2e5t [ 1 2 ] = [ C1e2t + C2e5t −C1e2t + 2C2e5t ] . • 3.4.8: Find the general solution of x′ 1 = x1 − 2x2, x′ 2 = 2x1 + x2 using the eigenvalue method. Do not use complex exponentials in your solution. Answer. Let ⃗x(t) = [ x1(t) x2(t) ] and A = [ 1 −2 2 1 ], then ⃗x′ = A⃗x. Let’s ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A, that is, we should solve det (A − λI2) = det [ 1 − λ −2 2 1 − λ ] = 0, then (λ − 1)2 + 4 = 0, which implies that λ1 = 1 + 2i, and λ2 = 1 − 2i. For λ1 = 1 + 2i, let’s solve A⃗x = (1 + 2i)⃗x, that is, [ −2i −2 2 −2i ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Then [ x1 x2 ] = x1 [ 1 −i ], that is, [ 1 −i ] is an eigenvalue for 1 + 2i. Then a complex solution can be eλ1t [ 1 −i ] = [ e(1+2i)t −ie(1+2i)t ] = [ et cos(2t) + iet sin(2t) et sin(2t) − iet cos(2t) ] = [ et cos(2t) et sin(2t) ] + i [ et sin(2t) −et cos(2t) ] 2 Therefore, the general solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x is: ⃗x(t) = C1 [ et cos(2t) et sin(2t) ] + C2 [ et sin(2t) −et cos(2t) ] = [ C1et cos(2t) + C2et sin(2t) C1et sin(2t) − C2et cos(2t) ] . • 3.7.2: Let A = [ 5 −3 3 −1 ]. Find the general solution of ⃗x′ = A⃗x. Answer. Let’s ﬁnd the eigenvalues of A, that is, we should solve det (λI2 − A) = det [ λ − 5 3 −3 λ + 1 ] = 0, then (λ − 5)(λ + 1) + 9 = 0, that is, λ2 − 4λ + 4 = 0, which implies that λ1 = λ2 = 2. It’s easy to see that 2I2 − A ̸= 0, that is, λ = 2 is a defective 1 eigenvalue of A. For λ = 2, let’s solve A⃗x = 2⃗x, that is, [ −3 3 −3 3 ] [ x1 x2 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Then [ x1 x2 ] = x1 [ 1 1 ], that is, [ 1 1 ] is an eigenvalue for 2. Then a solution can be e2t [ 1 1 ] . Let ⃗v = [ 1 1 ], that is, e2t⃗v is a solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x. Let ⃗y(t) = e2t(t⃗v + ⃗w) = te2t⃗v + e2t ⃗w for some ⃗w be such that ⃗y be a solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x, then ⃗y′ = e 2t⃗v + 2te2t⃗v + 2e2t ⃗w = A⃗y = te2tA⃗v + e 2tA ⃗w. Since A⃗v = 2⃗v, then e2t⃗v + 2e2t ⃗w = e2tA ⃗w, that is, (2I2 − A) ⃗w = −⃗v, which implies that [ −3 3 −3 3 ] [ w1 w2 ] = [ −1 −1 ] . So −3w1 + 3w2 = −1, we can take w1 = 0 and w2 = − 1 3 , then ⃗y(t) = te2t⃗v + e2t ⃗w = te2t [ 1 1 ] + e2t [ 0 − 1 3 ] . Therefore, the general solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x is: ⃗x(t) = C1e 2t [ 1 1 ] + C2te2t [ 1 1 ] + C2e2t [ 0 − 1 3 ] = [ C1e2t + C2te2t C1e2t + C2te2t − C2 3 e2t ] . 3 • 3.7.104: Let A = [ a a b c ] , where a, b and c are unknowns. Suppose that 5 is a doubled eigenvalue of defect 1, and suppose that [ 1 0 ] is the eigenvector. Find A and show that there is only one solution. Answer. Let’s solve det (λI2 − A) = det [ λ − a −a −b λ − c ] = 0, that is, (λ − a)(λ − c) − ab = 0, which implies that λ2 − (a + c)λ + ac − ab = 0. Since 5 is a doubled eigenvalue of defect 1, that is, λ = 5 is the only solution to λ2 − (a + c)λ + ac − ab = 0, then a + c = 10, and ac − ab = 25. (1) Since [ 1 0 ] is the eigenvalue for λ = 5, that is, [ 5 − a −a −b 5 − c ] [ 1 0 ] = [ 0 0 ] Then we have 5 − a = 0, and − b = 0. (2) By (1) and (2), we have a = 5, b = 0, and c = 5. Therefore, we know that A = [ 5 5 0 5 ] . • 3.5.101: Describe the behavior of the following systems without solving: a) x′ = x + y, y′ = x − y. b) x′ 1 = x1 + x2, x′ 2 = 2x2. c) x′ 1 = −2x2, x′ 2 = 2x1. d) x′ = x + 3y, y′ = −2x − 4y. e) x′ = x − 4y, y′ = −4x + y. Answer. a) The coeﬃcient matrix is A = [ 1 1 1 −1 ] , (3) which has characteristic polynomial λ2 − 2 = 0. Therefore the eigenvalues are λ = ± √2. Since they are both real and have opposite signs, the behaviour is saddle . 4 b) The coeﬃcient matrix is A = [1 1 0 2 ] , (4) which has characteristic polynomial (λ − 1)(λ − 2) = 0. Therefore the eigenvalues are λ = 1, 2. Since they are both real and positive the behaviour is source (unstable) . c) The coeﬃcient matrix is A = [ 0 −2 2 0 ] , (5) which has characteristic polynomial λ2+4 = 0. Therefore the eigenvalues are λ = ±2i. Since they are both purely imaginary, the behaviour is center point (ellipses) . d) The coeﬃcient matrix is A = [ 1 3 −2 −4 ] , (6) which has characteristic polynomial λ2 + 3λ + 2 = 0. Therefore the eigenvalues are λ = −1, −2. Since they are both real and negative, the behaviour is sink (stable) . e) The coeﬃcient matrix is A = [ 1 −4 −4 1 ] , (7) which has characteristic polynomial λ2 − 2λ − 15 = 0. Therefore the eigenvalues are λ = −3, 5. Since they are both real and of opposite sign, the behaviour is saddle . • 3.5.102: Suppose that ⃗x′ = A⃗x where A is a 2 × 2 matrix with eigenvalues 2 ± i. Describe the behavior. Answer. Since the eigenvalues are complex with positive real parts, the equilibrium at the origin is a spiral source . All nonzero solutions spiral around and move away from the origin. • 3.9.4: Find a particular solution to x′ = x + 2y + 2t, y′ = 3x + 2y − 4, a) using undetermined coeﬃcients, b) using variation of parameters. Answer. a) Since the inhomogeneous term is t [2 0 ] + [ 0 −4 ] , we try ⃗xp(t) = t⃗a + ⃗b, where ⃗a = [ a1 a2 ] ,⃗b = [b1 b2 ] are to be determined. Substituting ⃗xp(t) = t⃗a + ⃗b into the system gives 5 [ a1 a2 ] = t [ a1 + 2a2 3a1 + 2a2 ] + [ b1 + 2b2 3b1 + 2b2 ] + [ 2t −4 ] . Equating the coeﬃcients of t on both sides of the equation, we obtain a1 + 2a2 = −2 3a1 + 2a2 = 0. Equating the constants on both sides of the equation, we obtain b1 + 2b2 = a1 3b1 + 2b2 = a2 + 4. Solving the ﬁrst two equations gives a1 = 1 and a2 = −3/2. Solving the next two equations, we obtain b1 = 3/4 and b2 = 1/8. Therefore a particular solution is ⃗xp(t) = [ t + 3 4 − 3 2 t + 1 8 ] . b) The coeﬃcient matrix and inhomogeneous term for the system ⃗x′ = P ⃗x + ⃗f is P = [ 1 2 3 2 ] , ⃗f = [ 2t −4 ] . P has eigenvalues λ = −1 and 4 with corresponding eigenvectors [ 1 −1 ] and [2 3 ] respectively. Thus we can construct a fundamental matrix solution as X(t) = [ e−t 2e4t −e−t 3e4t ] . Then X(t) −1 = 1 5e3t [ 3e4t −2e4t e−t e−t ] = 1 5 [ 3et −2et e−4t e−4t ] . Let ⃗xp(t) = X(t)⃗u(t) be a particular solution to ⃗x′ + P ⃗x = ⃗f . Then ⃗u ′(t) = X(t)−1 ⃗f = 1 5 [ 3et −2et e−4t e−4t ] [ 2t −4 ] = 1 5 [ 6tet + 8et 2te−4t − 4e−4t ] . Then ⃗u(t) = ∫ ⃗u ′(t) dt = ∫ 1 5 [ 6tet + 8et 2te−4t − 4e−4t ] dt = 1 5 [ 6tet + 2et − 1 2 te−4t + 7 8 e−4t ] . So a particular solution is ⃗xp(t) = X(t)⃗u(t) = 1 5 [ e−t 2e4t −e−t 3e4t ] [ 6tet + 2et − 1 2 te−4t + 7 8 e−4t ] = [ t + 3 4 − 3 2 t + 1 8 ] . 6 • 3.9.101: Find a particular solution to x′ = 5x + 4y + t, y′ = x + 8y − t. a) using undetermined coeﬃcients. b) using variation of parameters. Answer. a) Since the inhomogeneous term contains only t’s we try a particular solution of the form ⃗xp = t⃗a + ⃗b. Substituting into the system gives [a1 a2 ] = t [5a1 + 4a2 a1 + 8a2 ] + [5b1 + 4b2 b1 + 8b2 ] + [ t −t ] . Equating powers of t in both entries we get the systems 5a1 + 4a2 = −1 a1 + 8a2 = 1 and 5b1 + 4b2 = a1 b1 + 8b2 = a2. Solving the ﬁrst system gives a1 = −1/3 and a2 = 1/6. Solving the second system gives b1 = −5/54 and b2 = 7/216. Therefore the particular solution is ⃗xp = [− 1 3 t − 5 54 1 6 t + 7 216 ] . b) The corresponding matrix and inhomogeneous vector for the problem ⃗x′ = P ⃗x + ⃗f is P = [5 4 1 8 ] , ⃗f = [ t −t ] . P has eigenvalues λ = 9, 4 with corresponding eigenvectors [ 1 1 ] and [−4 1 ]. Then we can take fundamental matrix to be: X(t) = [ e9t −4e4t e9t e4t ] . Then X(t) −1 = 1 5e13t [ e4t 4e4t −e9t e9t ] = 1 5 [ e−9t 4e−9t −e−4t e−4t ] . Let ⃗xp(t) = X(t)⃗u(t) be a particular solution to ⃗x′ = P ⃗x + ⃗f , then u ′(t) = X(t)−1 ⃗f = 1 5 [ e−9t 4e−9t −e−4t e−4t ] [ t −t ] = 1 5 [ −3te−9t −2te−4t ] 7 Then ⃗u(t) = ∫ ⃗u ′(t) dt = ∫ 1 5 [ −3te−9t −2te−4t ] dt = 1 5 [ 1 3 te−9t + 1 27 e−9t 1 2 te−4t + 1 8 e−4t ] So a particular solution can be: ⃗x(t) = X(t)⃗u(t) = 1 5 [ e9t −4e4t e9t e4t ] [ 1 3 te−9t + 1 27 e−9t 1 2 te−4t + 1 8 e−4t ] = [− 1 3 t − 5 54 1 6 t + 7 216 ] . • 3.9.102: Find a particular solution to x′ = y + et, y′ = x + et. a) using undetermined coeﬃcients. b) using variation of parameters. Answer. a) The corresponding matrix is A = [0 1 1 0 ] , which has characteristic equation λ2 − 1 = 0. Hence the eigenvalues are λ = ±1. Observe that the eigenvalue λ = 1 matches the power of the exponent that corresponds to the non-homogeneous part. Also, this eigenvalue has a corresponding eigenvector ⃗v = [1 1 ] . The particular solution is therefore of the form tet⃗a + et⃗b as is easily veriﬁed by substituting into the equation and keeping in mind that A⃗v = ⃗v ⃗x′ p = e t⃗a + tet⃗a + e t⃗b = A⃗xp + e t⃗v = tetA⃗a + e tA⃗b + et⃗v Then ⃗a + ⃗b = A⃗b + ⃗v, and ⃗a = A⃗a. Then we can take ⃗a = ⃗v = [ 1 1 ] , and ⃗b = 0. Hence the particular solution is ⃗xp = tet [1 1 ] . b) Matrix A has eigenvalues λ1 = 1, λ2 = −1 and the corresponding eigenvectors ⃗v1 = [1 1 ] , ⃗v2 = [ 1 −1 ]. Thus, the fundamental matrix is X(t) = [ et e−t et −e−t ] . 8 Its inverse is X(t)−1 = 1 −2 [ −e−t −e−t −et et ] = 1 2 [ e−t e−t et −et ] . Let ⃗xp(t) = X(t)⃗u(t) be a particular solution to ⃗x′ = A⃗x + ⃗f , then u(t) = ∫ X(t)−1 ⃗f dt = ∫ 1 2 [ e−t e−t et −et ] [ et et ] dt = [ t 0 ] , and ﬁnally ⃗x(t) = X(t)⃗u(t) = [ et e−t et −e−t ] [ t 0 ] = [ tet tet ] . 9","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
