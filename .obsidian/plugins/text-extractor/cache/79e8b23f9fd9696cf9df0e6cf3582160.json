A mass of m = 0.1 kg is attached to a spring. The spring constant is known to be k = 50N/m. Recall that the mass motion satisﬁes mx′′ + cx′ + kx = 0. You observe the spring oscillates with a frequency of 3 Hertz. Determine the friction constant c. Answer. Recall that characterisitic equation mλ2 + cλ + k = 0 has roots λ = − c 2m ± i 1 2m √4mk − c2. The solution is then given by x = Ae− c 2m tcos(ωt − C) where A, C are some constants that depend on initial conditions, and where ω = 1 2m √4mk − c2. Frequency of 3 Hertz means three full oscillations per second, so that ω = 3 × 2π = 6π. Solving for c we then obtain c = √4mk − 4m2ω2 ≈ 2.4058. 2. A small object of mass 1 kg is attached to a spring with spring constant 2 N/m. This spring- mass system is immersed in a viscous medium with damping constant 3 N· s/m. At time t = 0, the mass is lowered 1/2 m below its equilibrium position, and released. Show that the mass will creep back to its equilibrium position as t approaches inﬁnity. Answer. Let x(t) be the position of the mass away from the equilibrium position at time t, then our diﬀerential equation is: x′′ + 3x′ + 2x = 0, x(0) = 0.5, x ′(0) = 0. The characteristic equation of x′′ + 3x′ + 2x = 0 is r2 + 3r + 2 = 0, then r1 = −1 and r2 = −2, which implies that the general solution to x′′ + 3x′ + 2x = 0 is: x(t) = C1e −t + C2e −2t. Since x(0) = 0.5, then C1 + C2 = 0.5. Since x′(t) = −C1e−t − 2C2e−2t and x′(0) = 0, then −C1 − 2C2 = 0. So we get C1 = 1, C2 = −0.5. Hence x(t) = e−t − 0.5e−2t. In particular, we have x(t) → 0 as t → ∞, which means that the mass will creep back to its equilibrium position as t approaches inﬁnity. In fact, x(t) → 0 as t → ∞ for any initial conditions. 3. A small object of mass 1 kg is attached to a spring with spring-constant 1 N/m and is immersed in a viscous medium with damping constant 2 N· s/m. At time t = 0, the mass is lowered 1/4 m and given an initial velocity of 1 m/s in the upward direction. Show that the mass will overshoot its equilibrium position once, and then creep back to equilibrium. Answer. Let x(t) be the position of the mass away from the equilibrium position at time t, then our diﬀerential becomes: x′′ + 2x′ + x = 0, x(0) = −1/4, x ′(0) = 1. 1 The characteristic equation of x′′ + 2x′ + x = 0 is r2 + 2r + 1 = 0, then r1 = r2 = −1, which implies that the general solution to x′′ + 2x′ + x = 0 is: x(t) = C1e−t + C2te−t. Since x(0) = 1/4, then C1 = −1/4. Since x′(t) = −C1e−t + C2e−t − C2te−t and x′(0) = 1, then −C1 + C2 = 1. So we get C2 = 3/4. Hence x(t) = − 1 4 e −t + 3 4 te−t = 1 4 e−4[3t − 1]. So at time t = 1/3, we know that x(1/3) = 0, which means that the mass will overshoot its equilibrium position once. On the other hand, we know that x(t) → 0 as t → ∞, which means that the mass will creep back to equilibrium as t approaches inﬁnity. 4. Using the mks units (meters-kilograms-seconds), suppose you have a spring with spring constant 4 N/m. You want to use it to weigh items. Assume no friction. You place the mass on the spring and put it in motion. a) You count and ﬁnd that the frequency is 0.8 Hz (cycles per second). What is the mass? b) Find a formula for the mass m given the frequency ω in Hz. Answer. Since the motion is undamped, then the requency is ω0 = √ k m = √ 4 m . a) If ω0 = 0.8π = 1.6π, then 1.6π = √ 4 m , which implies that m = 4 1.62π2 . b) In general, we know that ω · 2π = √ 4 m , then m = 4 4ω2π2 = 1 π2ω2 . 5. Find the general solution to y′′ + 4y = x3 − 1. Answer. The characterisitc equation of y′′ + 4y = 0 is r2 + 4 = 0, then r1 = 2i and r2 = −2i, which implies that the general solution to y′′ + 4y = 0 is: yc(x) = C1 cos(2x) + C2 sin(2x). Let yp(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d be a particular solution to y′′ + 4y = x3 − 1, then y′ p = 3ax 2 + 2bx + c, y′′ p = 6ax + 2b. So we get y′′ p + 4yp = 6ax + 2b + 4(ax3 + bx2 + cx + d) = 4ax 3 + 4bx 2 + (6a + 4c)x + 4d + 2b = x 3 − 1. So we have 4a = 1, 4b = 0, 6a + 4c = 0, 4d + 2b = −1. Hence a = 1/4, b = 0, c = −3/8, d = −1/4. So we get yp(x) = 1 4 x3 − 3 8 x − 1 4 . 2 Therefore, the general solution to y′′ + 4y = x3 − 1 is: y(x) = yc(x) + yp(x) = C1 cos(2x) + C2 sin(2x) + 1 4 x3 − 3 8 x − 1 4 . 6. Solve the initial value problem y′′ + 9y = cos(3x) for y(0) = 0 and y′(0) = 1. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ + 9y = 0 is r2 + 9 = 0, then r1 = 3i and r2 = −3i, which implies that the general solution to y′′ + 9y = 0 is: yc(x) = C1 cos(3x) + C2 sin(3x). Let yp(x) = x[a cos(3x) + b sin(3x)] be a particular solution to y′′ + 9y = cos(3x), then y′ p(x) = a cos(3x) + b sin(3x) + x[−3a sin(3x) + 3b cos(3x)] y′′ p (x) = −3a sin(3x) + 3b cos(3x) − 3a sin(3x) + 3b cos(3x) + x[−9a cos(3x) − 9b sin(3x)] = −6a sin(3x) + 6b cos(3x) + x[−9a cos(3x) − 9b sin(3x)]. So we get y′′ p + 9yp = −6a sin(3x) + 6b cos(3x) + x[−9a cos(3x) − 9b sin(3x)] + 9x[a cos(3x) + b sin(3x)] = −6a sin(3x) + 6b cos(3x) = cos(3x). So −6a = 0 and 6b = 1, that is, a = 0 and b = 1/6. So yp(x) = 1 6 x sin(3x). Hence the general solution to y′′ + 9y = cos(3x) is: y(x) = yc(x) + yp(x) = C1 cos(3x) + C2 sin(3x) + 1 6 x sin(3x). Since y(0) = 0, then C1 = 0, which implies that y(x) = C2 sin(3x) + 1 6 x sin(3x). Since y′(x) = 3C2 cos(3x) + 3 6 x cos(3x) + 1 6 sin(3x) and y′(0) = 1, then 3C2 = 1, that is, C2 = 1/3. So we know that y(x) = 1 3 sin(3x) + 1 6 x sin(3x). 7. Let k be a real constant, ﬁnd a particular solution to y′′ − 2y′ + y = ekx. (Hint: You should consider two cases: k = 1 or k ̸= 1). Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − 2y′ + y = 0 is r2 − 2r + 1 = 0, then r1 = r2 = 1. • When k = 1. Let yp(x) = ax2ex be a particular solution to y′′ − 2y′ + y = ekx, then y′ p(x) = 2axex + ax2e x, y′′ p (x) = 2aex + 2axex + 2axex + ax2e x = 2aex + 4axee + ax 2ex. 3 So we have y′′ p − 2y′ p + yp = 2aex + 4axee + ax 2ex − 2[2axe x + ax 2ex] + ax 2ex = 2aex = e x. So 2a = 1, that is, a = 1/2. Hence yp(x) = 1 2 x2e x. • When k ̸= 1, let yp(x) = aekx be a particular solution to y′′ − 2y′ + y = ekx, then y′ p(x) = akekx, y′′ p (x) = ak2ekx. So we get y′′ p − 2y′ p + yp = ak2ekx − 2ake kx + akekx = aekx[k2 − 2k + 1] = e kx. So a[k2 − 2k + 1] = 1, that is a = (k − 1)−2. So yp(x) = (k − 1) −2e kx. 8. Let k be a real constant, ﬁnd a particular solution to y′′ + y = cos(kx). (Hint: You should consider two cases: k = ±1 or k ̸= ±1). Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ + y = 0 is r2 + 1 = 0, then r1 = i and r2 = −i. • When k = ±1, let yp(x) = x[a cos(x) + b sin(x)] be a particular solution to y′′ + y = cos(kx) = cos(x), then y′ p = a cos(x) + b sin(x) + x[−a sin(x) + b cos(x)] y′′ p = −a sin(x) + b cos(x) − a sin(x) + b cos(x) + x[−a cos(x) − b sin(x)] = −2a sin(x) + 2b cos(x) + x[−a cos(x) − b sin(x)]. So y′′ p + yp = −2a sin(x) + 2b cos(x) + x[−a cos(x) − b sin(x)] + x[a cos(x) + b sin(x)] = −2a sin(x) + 2b cos(x) = cos(x). Then −2a = 0 and 2b = 1, then a = 0 and b = 1/2. Hence yp(x) = 1 2 x sin(x). 4 • When k ̸= ±1, let yp = a cos(kx) + b sin(kx) be a particular solution to y′′ + ky = cos(kx), then y′ p = −ak sin(kx) + bk cos(kx), y′′ p = −ak2 cos(kx) − bk2 sin(kx). So we get y′′ p + yp = −ak2 cos(kx) + bk2 sin(kx) + a cos(kx) + b sin(kx) = a(1 − k2) cos(kx) + b(1 − k2) sin(kx) = cos(kx). Then a(1 − k2) = 1 and b(1 − k2) = 0, then a = 1 1−k2 and b = 0. Hence yp(x) = 1 1 − k2 cos(kx). 9. Find a form of a particular solution to y′′ + 4y = x sin(2x) (You do not need to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients). Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ + 4y = 0 is r2 + 4 = 0, then r1 = 2i and r2 = −2i. A particular solution is of the form yp(x) = x · [(ax + b) cos(2x) + (cx + d) sin(2x)]. Indeed, one can use wolfram to get yp(x) = − 1 8 x2 cos(2x) + 1 16 x sin(2x), that is, a = −1/8, b = c = 0 and d = 1/16. 10. Find the general solution to y′′ + 2y′ = 1 + e−2x. Answer. The characterisitc equation of y′′ + 2y′ = 0 is r2 + 2r = 0, then r1 = 0 and r2 = −2, which implies that the general solution to y′′ + 2y′ = 0 is: yc(x) = C1 + C2e −2x. Let yp(x) = ax + bxe−2x be a particular solution to y′′ + 2y′ = 1 + e−2x, then y′ p = a + be −2x − 2bxe −2x, y′′ p = −2be −2x − 2be −2x + 4bxe −2x = −4be−2x + 4bxe−2x. Then y′′ p + 2y′ p = −4be−2x + 4bxe−2x + 2[a + be −2x − 2bxe −2x] = −2be−2x + 2a = 1 + e −2x Then −2b = 1 and 2a = 1, that is, a = 1/2 and b = −1/2. Hence yp(x) = x 2 − 1 2 xe−2x. So the general solution to y′′ + 2y′ = 1 + e−2x is: y(x) = yc(x) + yp(x) = C1 + C2e−2x + x 2 − 1 2 xe−2x. 5 11. Find a particular solution to y′′ − 4y = xe2x. Answer. The characteristic equation of y′′ − 4y = 0 is r2 − 4 = 0, then r1 = 2 and r2 = −2. Let yp(x) = x(ax + b)e2x = (ax2 + bx)e2x be a particular solution to y′′ − 4y = xe2x, then y′ p = (2ax + b)e 2x + 2(ax 2 + bx)e 2x = e2x[2ax 2 + (2a + 2b)x + b] y′′ p = 2ae2x + 2(2ax + b)e 2x + 2(2ax + b)e 2x + 4(ax 2 + bx)e 2x = e2x[2a + 4ax + 2b + 4ax + 2b + 4ax 2 + 4bx) = e2x[4ax 2 + (8a + 4b)x + 2a + 4b]. So y′′ p − 4yp = e2x[4ax 2 + (8a + 4b)x + 2a + 4b] − 4(ax 2 + bx)e 2x = e2x[8x + 2a + 4b] = xe2x. So 8a = 1 and 2a + 4b = 0, which implies that a = 1/8 and b = −1/16. Hence yp(x) = 1 8 x2e2x − 1 16 xe2x. 6","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
