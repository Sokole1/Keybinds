November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 2 of 7 1. Consider the following second order ODE: x′′ + 4x′ + 4x = 0. (1) (a)(4 points) Find the general solution of the ODE (1). Answer. The characteristic equation is: 0 = λ2 + 4λ + 4 = (λ + 2)2, which has λ = −2 as the repeated root. Two solutions are y1 = e−2t and y2 = te−2t. Solution: x(t) = C1e−2t + C2te−2t. (b)(4 points) Solve the ODE (1) with the initial conditions x(0) = 1 and x′(0) = v. Answer. Plugging in t = 0 to the general solution we have: 1 = x(0) = C1e−2(0) + C2(0)e−2(0) = C1. Diﬀerentiating and plugging in x′(0) = v we get v = x′(0) = −2C1e−2(0) + C2e −2(0) − 2C2(0)e−2(0) = −2 + C2, so C2 = v + 2. Solution: x = e −2t + (v + 2)te −2t. (c)(2 points) For what values of v is x(t) > 0 for all t ≥ 0? Justify your answer. Answer. If v > −2 then the coeﬃcients to both terms are positive so the solution is positive. If v = −2 then the solution is just e−2t, which stays positive. If v < −2, then the solution eventually becomes negative because −(v + 2)te−2t > e−2t for suﬃciently large t. Solution: The solution satisﬁes x(t) > 0 for all t ≥ 0 for the v values v ≥ −2. November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 3 of 7 2. (Do NOT use Laplace transform. Minus additional 1 point for using it.) An undamped spring is stretched 1 m by a force of 6 N. (1 N = 1 kg·m s2 .) A mass of 2 kg is attached at the end of the spring with position x = 0 m when the spring is at rest. A force is applied of 5t2 N. (Hint: The mass spring system has equation mx′′ + cx′ + kx = 0 where m is the mass attached to the spring, c is the damping coeﬃcient so that the damping force is −cx′, and k is the spring constant so that the force is −kx when the spring is stretched by x.) (a)(5 points) Write down the nonhomogeneous undamped spring equation and ﬁnd a particular solution. Answer. The spring constant is k = 6 N/m. The equation is: 2x′′ + 6x = 5t2. Using the method of undetermined coeﬃcients, we look for a particular solution of the form: xp(t) = At2 + Bt + C. Plugging in xp into the equation we have: 4A + 6At2 + 6Bt + 6C = 5t 2. This yields the equations 6A = 5, 6B = 0, and 4A + 6C = 0. Solving for A, B, C we get A = 5 6 , B = 0, C = − 4 6 5 6 = − 5 9 . Solution: xp = 5 6 t2 − 5 9 . November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 4 of 7 (b)(5 points) Instead, a force is applied of 10 cos(ωt) N/m, where ω is the natural frequency of the spring. Solve for the position x(t) with x(0) = 5 and x′(0) = 0. (Hint: the particular solution will be of the form xp = At sin(ωt).) Answer. The natural frequency is ω = √3. We calculate: x ′ p = A sin( √3t) + √3At cos(√3t), x′′ p = 2 √3A cos(√3t) − 3A sin( √3t). So: 4√3A cos(√3t) − 6A sin( √3t) + 6A sin(√3t) = 10 cos(√3t). We ﬁnd: xp = 5 2 √3 t sin( √3t). Plugging in the initial conditions we have xp(0) = x′ p(0) = 0, so for: xc = B cos(√ 3t) + C sin(√3t), B = 5 and C = 0. Solution: x = 5 cos( √ 3t) + 5 2 √3 t sin( √3t). November 2019 Math 215/255 Midterm II Page 5 of 7 3. (a)(6 points) Using the Laplace transform, ﬁnd the solution x1(t), called the impulse response, of the following initial value problem: x′′ 1 + 2x′ 1 + 2x1 = 0 x1(0) = 0, x′ 1(0) = 1. Answer. Let X1(s) = L[x1(t)](s). We apply the Laplace transform on both sides of the ODE. Knowing that: L[x′ 1] = sX1(s) − x1(0) = sX1(s) L[x′′ 1] = s2X1(s) − sx1(0) − x ′ 1(0) = s 2X1(s) − 1, we obtain: s2X1(s) + 2sX1(s) + 2X1(s) = 1 X1(s) = 1 s2 + 2s + 2 . The denominator s2 + 2s + 2 has no real roots but can be rewritten by completing the square as s2 + 2s + 2 = (s + 1)2 + 1. Therefore, using the ﬁrst shift property, we have: x1(t) = L −1[X1(s)](t) = L −1 [ 1 (s + 1)2 + 1 ] (t) = e −tL −1 [ 1 s2 + 1 ] (t) = e−t sin(t). Solution: x1(t) = e−t sin(t). (b)(4 points) Let x2(t) be the solution of the following (diﬀerent) initial value problem: x′′ 2 + 2x′ 2 + 2x2 = f (t) x2(0) = 0, x′ 2(0) = 0. Find the solution x2(t) when the forcing f (t) = e−t is applied, knowing that the solution x2(t) veriﬁes: x2(t) = (x1 ∗ f )(t), where x1(t) is the solution of the previous question. Answer. Using the previous question, we have: x2(t) = (x1 ∗ f )(t) = ∫ t 0 e −τ sin(τ )e −(t−τ )dτ = e−t ∫ t 0 sin(τ )dτ = e−t[1 − cos(t)]. Solution: x2(t) = e−t[1 − cos(t)].

We ﬁrst rewrite f (t) using Heaviside functions: f (t) = t[u(t) − u(t − 1)] + (2 − t)u(t − 1) = t − tu(t − 1) + (2 − t)u(t − 1) = t + (2 − 2t)u(t − 1) = t − 2(t − 1)u(t − 1). By the second shifting property L[u(t − a)f (t − a)] = e−asF (s), we have L[f (t)](s) = L[t] − 2L[(t − 1)u(t − 1)] = 1 s2 − 2e−sL[t](s) = 1 s2 − 2e−s s2 . Solution: L[f (t)](s) = 1 s2 − 2e−s s2 (b)(5 points) Find the inverse Laplace transform of: X(s) = 1 − 2e−s s2(s2 + 1) . Answer. Using partial fractions, we have: 1 s2(s2 + 1) = A s + B s2 + Cs + D s2 + 1 = 1 s2 − 1 s2 + 1 for A = 0, B = 1, C = 0, D = −1. Using the second shift property and knowing that L−1[1/s2] = t and L−1[1/(s2 + 1)] = sin(t), we have: x(t) = L −1[X(s)](t) = L −1[ 1 s2 ] − 2L −1[ e−s s2 ] − L −1[ 1 s2 + 1 ] + 2L −1[ e−s s2 + 1 ] = t − 2(t − 1)u(t − 1) − sin(t) + 2 sin(t − 1)u(t − 1). = t − sin(t) − 2u(t − 1)[(t − 1) − sin(t − 1)] Solution: x(t) = t − sin(t) − 2u(t − 1)[(t − 1) − sin(t − 1)].
