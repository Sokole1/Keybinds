Ordinary point x0: Two linearly independent solutions of the form: y(x)= P1 n=0 an(x \u0000 x0) n Regular singular point x0: Rearrange (?) as: (x \u0000 x0) 2y00 + [(x \u0000 x0)p(x)](x \u0000 x0)y0 + [(x \u0000 x0) 2q(x)]y =0 If r1 >r2 are roots of the indicial equation: r(r \u0000 1) + br + c = 0 where b = lim x!x0(x \u0000 x0)p(x) and c = lim x!x0(x \u0000 x0) 2q(x) then a solution of (?) is y1(x)= P1 n=0 an(x \u0000 x0) n+r1 where a0 =1. The second linerly independent solution y2 is of the form: Case 1: If r1 \u0000 r2 is neither 0 nor a positive integer: y2(x)= 1X n=0 bn(x \u0000 x0) n+r2 where b0 =1.

(2) All eigenvalues are real and can be ordered as \u00001 < \u00002 < ·· · < \u0000n < ·· · with \u0000n !1 as n !1, and each eigenvalue admits a unique (up to a scalar factor) eigenfunction \u0000n.
