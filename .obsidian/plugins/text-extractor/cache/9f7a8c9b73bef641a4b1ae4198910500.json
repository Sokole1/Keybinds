The long run fraction of bad chips produced is 20%. It is expensive to thoroughly test a chip to determine whether it is good or bad, and a cheap but less eﬀective test is used instead. All good chips will pass the cheap test, but so will 10% of the bad chips. (a)(8 marks) What proportion of chips that pass the cheap test are in fact good chips? (b)(2 marks) If all chips that pass the cheap test are sold, what percentage of chips sold will be bad chips? April 21 2017 MATH 318 Final Exam Page 5 of 14 3.(10 marks) An astrophysicist performs an experiment to measure the distance d in light years between two stars, but her measurements are not completely accurate due to experimental errors. Suppose that each measurement is an independent random variable with mean equal to the true distance d and variance 9 (light years)2. She uses the average of her measurements as an estimate for d. Using the central limit theorem, determine the number of measurements needed to be 95% conﬁdent that the estimated distance is within ±1 light year of the true distance.

The random walk on the 3-dimensional body-centred cubic lattice is the random walk on Z3 that takes steps (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, −1), (1, −1, 1), (1, −1, −1), (−1, 1, 1), (−1, 1, −1), (−1, −1, 1), (−1, −1, −1) with equal probabilities 1 8 .

Determine (give details) whether the integral of 1 1−ϕi(⃗k) near ⃗k = (0, 0, 0) is ﬁnite or inﬁnite. (d)(2 marks) Is the random walk on the body-centred cubic lattice recurrent or transient? Explain. April 21 2017 MATH 318 Final Exam Page 12 of 14 7. An urn contains 8 balls, some of them white and some of them black. At each time step, a ball is chosen from the urn at random. With probability p the chosen ball is replaced by a white ball, and with probability 1 − p it is replaced by a black ball. The state of the system is the number of white balls in the urn. This deﬁnes a Markov chain. (a)(2 marks) Determine all communicating classes, their periods, and their transience or recurrence. (b)(3 marks) Determine the transition probabilities Pij. (c)(5 marks) Using any method (and justifying your answer), ﬁnd the proportion of time spent by the Markov chain in each state. April 21 2017 MATH 318 Final Exam Page 13 of 14 8. Smith has three books B1, B2, B3 which he keeps on a shelf when he is not reading. After he reads a book, he returns it to the left of the other books on the shelf. His favourite book is B1, which he selects to read with probability 2 3 . He selects B2 with probability 1 6 , and he selects book B3 also with probability 1 6 . This deﬁnes a Markov chain, with the state of the system given by the diﬀerent possible orders for the books on the shelf. In your solution, order your states in the order: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321. (a)(3 marks) Write down the transition matrix for the Markov chain. (b)(6 marks) Determine the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. (c)(1 marks) Suppose the books are now in order B3B2B1. How many times will Smith select a book again, on average, until the books are again in the same order?
