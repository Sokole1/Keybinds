We begin with tests which use decimal notation. In the following discussion let n = (agag_,...a1ag)yo. Then n =a;10% + a,_ 107+ - + 4,10 + aq, with 0 < a; < 9 for j=0.1, 2,...k. First, we develop tests for divisibility by powers of 2. Since 10 = 0 (mod 2), Theorem 3.5 tells us that 10/ = 0 (mod 2/) for all positive integers j. Hence, n = (a,) o (mod 2), n = (a,aq) 1o (mod 2%), n = (a,a,a¢)10 (mod 2%), n = (aj_18;-... aa1ap) 1o (mod 2/) . These congruences tell us that to determine whether an integer » is divisible by 2, we only need to examine its last digit for divisibility by 2. Similarly, to determine whether n is divisible by 4, we only need to check the integer made up of the last two digits of n for divisibility by 4. In general, to test n for divisibility by 2/, we only need to check the integer made up of the last j digits of n for divisibility by 2/. 129 130 Applications of Congruences Example. Let n = 22688048, We sce that 2| n since 218, 4 since +8 | n since 8 [ 48,16 | n since 16 | 8048, but 32 | n since 32 / 88048.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
