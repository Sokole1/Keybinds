Suggest numerically suitable formulas that address the situations encountered in this question and would result in computing more accurate results on this floating point system for the values of a,b, and Â¢ in Scripts 1 and 2. There is no need to use MATLAB syntax.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
