(a) Consider the parametrized space curve r(t) = (t 2, t, t3) Find an equation for the normal plane at the point (1, 1, 1). (b) Find the curvature of the curve from (a) as a function of the parameter t. 2. (a) Let r(t) = ( t 2, 3, 1 3t 3) Find the unit tangent vector to this parametrized curve at t = 1, pointing in the direction of increasing t. (b) Find the arc length of the curve from (a) between the points (0, 3, 0) and (1, 3, − 1 3). 3. (a) Consider the vector ﬁeld F(x, y, z) = (z + e y, xe y − ez sin y, 1 + x + e z cos y) Find the curl of F. Is F conservative? (b) Find the integral ∫ C F·dr of the ﬁeld F from (a) where C is the curve with parametriza- tion r(t) = (t2, sin t, cos 2 t) where t ranges from 0 to π. 4. (a) Consider the vector ﬁeld F(x, y, z) = (z2, x 2, y2) in R3. Compute the line integral∮ C F · dr, where C is the curve consisting of the three line segments, L1 from (2, 0, 0) to (0, 2, 0), then L2 from (0, 2, 0) to (0, 0, 2), and ﬁnally L3 from (0, 0, 2) to (2, 0, 0). (b) A simple closed curve C lies in the plane x + y + z = 2. The surface this curve C surrounds inside the plane x + y + z = 2 has area 3. The curve C is oriented in a counterclockwise direction as observed from the positive x-axis. Compute the line integral ∮ C F · dr , where F is as in (a). 5. (a) Find a parametrization of the surface S of the cone whose vertex is at the point (0, 0, 3), and whose base is the circle x2+y2 = 4 in the xy–plane. Only the cone surface belongs to S, not the base. Be careful to include the domain for the parameters. (b) Find the z–coordinate of the centre of mass of the surface S from (a). 1 6. (a) Find an upward pointing unit normal vector to the surface z = xy at the point (1, 1, 1). (b) Now consider the part of the surface z = xy, which lies within the cylinder x2 +y2 = 9 and call it S. Compute the upward ﬂux of F = (y, x, 3) through S. (c) Find the ﬂux of F = (y, x, 3) through the cylindrical surface x2 + y2 = 9 in between z = xy and z = 10. The orientation is outward, away from the z-axis. 7. (a) Find the divergence of the vector ﬁeld F = (x + sin y, z + y, z2). (b) Find the ﬂux of F through the upper hemisphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 25, z ≥ 0, oriented in the positive z–direction. (c) Specify an oriented closed surface S, such that the ﬂux ∫∫ S F · ˆn dS is equal to −9. 8. True or false? (a) ∇∇∇·(a×r) = 0, where a is a constant vector in R 3 , and r is the vector ﬁeld r = (x, y, z). (b) ∇∇∇ × (∇∇∇f ) = 0 for all scalar ﬁelds f on R 3 with continuous second partial derivatives. (c) ∇∇∇ · (f F) = ∇∇∇(f ) · F + f∇∇∇ · F, for every vector ﬁeld F in R3 with continuous partial derivatives, and every scalar function f in R 3 with continuous partial derivatives. (d) Suppose F is a vector ﬁeld with continuous partial derivatives in the region D, where D is R 3 without the origin. If ∇∇∇ · F > 0 throughout D, then the ﬂux of F through the sphere of radius 5 with center at the origin is positive. (e) If a vector ﬁeld F is deﬁned and has continuous partial derivatives everywhere in R 3, and it satisﬁes ∇∇∇ · F = 0, everywhere, then, for every sphere, the ﬂux out of one hemisphere is equal to the ﬂux into the opposite hemisphere. (f) If r(t) is a twice continuously diﬀerentiable path in R2 with constant curvature κ, then r(t) parametrizes part of a circle of radius 1/κ. (g) The vector ﬁeld F = (− y x2+y2 , x x2+y2 ) is conservative in its domain, which is R 2, without the origin. (h) If a vector ﬁeld F = (P, Q) in R2 has Q = 0 everywhere in R 2, then the line integral∮ F · dr is zero, for every simple closed curve in R 2. (i) If the acceleration and the speed of a moving particle in R 3 are constant, then the motion is taking place along a spiral. 2","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
