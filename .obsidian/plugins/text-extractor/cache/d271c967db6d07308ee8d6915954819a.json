In particular consider 2’ = (0.4 — 0.01y)z — vz, o = (0.003z — 0.3)y. For the following two values of v, find and classify all the critical points in the positive quadrant, that is, for £ > 0 and y > 0. a) v = 0.001, b) v =0.01. Remark. You can skip the following in the original problem: “Then sketch the phase diagram. Discuss the implication for the long term behavior of the population.” It helps to give intuition.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
