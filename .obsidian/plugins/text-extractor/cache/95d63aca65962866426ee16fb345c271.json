To show that it’s NP-complete, we need to also show that it is NP-hard; that is, that it’s at least as hard as every other problem in NP. We’ll use 3-SAT to help us, since we already know that 3-SAT is at least as hard as every other problem in NP. 1. Which of these would show that ST is at least as hard as 3-SAT: reducing from ST to 3-SAT in polynomial time or reducing from 3-SAT to ST in polynomial time? (Hint: We know that any problem in NP can be reduced to 3-SAT in polynomial time. We want to prove that any problem in NP can be reduced to ST in polynomial time.)","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
