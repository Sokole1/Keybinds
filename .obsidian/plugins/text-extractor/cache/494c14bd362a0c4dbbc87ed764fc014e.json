Calculate the inverse Laplace transform x(t) = L −1{X(s)} of the following functions (a) 2 marks X(s) = 3s + 2 s2 + 5 Answer: x(t) = 3 cos(√5t) + 2√5 sin( √ 5t) Solution: 3s + 2 s2 + 5 = 3 s s2 + (√ 5)2 + 2 √5 √5 s2 + (√5)2 (b) 2 marks X(s) = s + 2 s2 + 4s + 8 Answer: x(t) = e−2t cos(2t) Solution: s + 2 s2 + 4s + 8 = s + 2 (s + 2)2 + 22 Then use shifting property (property 6 in the LT table). Page 3 of 8 (c) 2 marks X(s) = 5 s(s2 + 7) Answer: x(t) = 5 7(1 − cos( √7t)) Solution: Method 1: Using property 9 in the LT table 5 s(s2 + 7) = F (s) s , L −1{ 5 s2 + 7 } = 5 √7 sin( √7t) and x(t) = ∫ t 0 5 √7 sin( √7τ )dτ = 5 7(1 − cos(√ 7t) Method 2: Partial Fraction Decomposition 5 s(s2 + 7) = 5 7 ( 1 s − s s2 + 7 ) (d) 2 marks X(s) = e −6s s2 − 6s + 9 Answer: x(t) = u(t − 6)e3(t−6)(t − 6) Solution: e −6s s2 − 6s + 9 = e −6sF (s) , F (s) = 1 s2 − 6s + 9 = 1 (s − 3)2 L −1{ 1 (s − 3)2 } = te3t Then use shifting property (property 8 in the LT table). Page 4 of 8 2. Consider the following IVP: x′′ + 4x = e−2t , x(0) = 0 , x ′(0) = 1 (a) 2 marks Give the expression of the Laplace transform of the solution X(s) = L {x(t)}. Answer: X(s) = 1 (s+2)(s2+4) + 1 s2+4 Solution: We take the LT of the ODE and get: s2X(s) − 1 + 4X(s) = 1 s + 2 which gives X(s) = 1 (s + 2)(s2 + 4) + 1 s2 + 4 Page 5 of 8 (b) 4 marks Find the solution x(t) through calculating L −1{X(s)}. Answer: x(t) = − 1 8 cos(2t) + 5 8 sin(2t) + 1 8e−2t Solution: L −1{X(s)} = L −1{ 1 (s + 2)(s2 + 4) } + L −1{ 1 s2 + 4 } The second term is straightforward and gives L −1{ 1 s2 + 4 } = 1 2 sin(2t) The ﬁrst term requires Partial Fraction Decomposition 1 (s + 2)(s2 + 4) = 1 8 ( 1 s + 2 + −s + 2 s2 + 4 ) and L −1{ 1 8 ( 1 s + 2 + −s + 2 s2 + 4 ) } = 1 8 (e −2t − cos(2t) + sin(2t)) Summing we get: x(t) = −1 8 cos(2t) + 5 8 sin(2t) + 1 8 e −2t The ﬁrst term can also be written as a convolution with F (s) = 1 s+2 and G(s) = 1 s2+4, f (t) = L −1{F (s)} = e −2t and g(t) = L −1{G(s)} = 1 2 sin(2t), and then calculate the convolution by Integration By Parts. Page 6 of 8 3. Consider the following IVP: x′′ + 7x′ + 3x = f (t) , x(0) = 0 , x ′(0) = 0 where f (t) is deﬁned as follows: f (t) =  || || 0 0 ≤ t < 3 −2 3 ≤ t < 5 7 5 ≤ t < 9 0 9 ≤ t (a) 2 marks Write f (t) with Heaviside functions. Answer: f (t) = −2u(t − 3) + 9u(t − 5) − 7u(t − 9) Solution: We use Heaviside functions with a = 3, 5 and 9 and adjust the intensity. (b) 1 mark Give x(t) when 0 ≤ t < 3. Shortly explain. Answer: x(t) = 0 when 0 ≤ t < 3 Solution: The system starts from equilibrium since x(0) = x′(0) = 0 and there is no forcing for 0 ≤ t < 3, so the system stays at equilibrium and x(t) = 0 Page 7 of 8 (c) 3 marks Calculate the Laplace transform of the solution X(s) = L {x(t)} Answer: X(s) = −2e−3s+9e−5s−7e−9s s(s2+7s+3) Solution: We take the LT of the ODE, plug the 2 ICs and get s2X(s) + 7sX(s) + 3X(s) = −2e−3s + 9e−5s − 7e−9s s This gives: X(s) = −2e−3s + 9e−5s − 7e−9s s(s2 + 7s + 3) Page 8 of 8","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
