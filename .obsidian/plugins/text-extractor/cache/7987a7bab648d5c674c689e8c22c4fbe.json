Let Q be orthogonal with SVD given by Q@ = USV”. Then QTQ = I = VETUTULVT = VETSVT, from which it follows that £7% = I and hence all singular values are 1. (b) Not quite unique, for example U and V' are only determined up to sign. There is a bit more to say here, but let’s leave it at this.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
