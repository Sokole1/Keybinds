This spring- mass system is immersed in a viscous medium with damping constant 3 N- s/m. At time ¢ = 0, the mass is lowered 1/2 m below its equilibrium position, and released. Show that the mass will creep back to its equilibrium position as ¢ approaches infinity.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
