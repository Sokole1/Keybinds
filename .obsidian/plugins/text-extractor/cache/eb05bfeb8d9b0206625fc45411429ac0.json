(8 points) The hyperbolic tangent function is given by T _ o tanh(z) = c-e et +e T A graph of this function on the interval [—3, 3] is given below: B yetanht) - 08 o8 04 02 >0 02 04 o5 o8 L a 2 V o T 2 3 The value of the function at 0 is 0: tanh(0) = 0. 2 pts (a) Suppose we are interested in computing the function value accurately (on the given floating point system) for small values of z # 0 and we do not have access to the tanh library function. If we use MATLAB to compute tanh(z) based on the exponential function using the above formula, we notice that the command y=(exp(x)-exp(-x))/ (exp(x)+exp(-x)) gives y=0 when x is very small. This is an unsatisfying evaluation of the function y = tanh(z) for z # 0, as there are no meaningful correct decimal digits in this approximation. Show, using Taylor series, that tanh(z) ~ z for « very small, and therefore the value of itself is an effective approximation of tanh(z) for z < 1. If it helps, the first few terms of the Taylor series of a function f(z) about 0 are given by f(z) = f(0)+/f'(0)z+ %9112# . and the derivative of the specific function f(z) = tanh(z) is f'(z) =1 — tanh®(z). You may assume that z is so small that values such as z?, 3, or similar may be ignored.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
