[Total 5 marks for this question] The IEEE 754 floating system with double precision uses base 8 = 2 and has 52 bits in its mantissa, plus one more leading bit which is not explicitly stored. This system allows us to represent numbers with approximately 16 correct decimal digits. The largest finite positive number that can be represented on the system is approximately 1.8 x 103%%. We are required to compute expressions of the form fz) = Va2 +0.01 — V22 — 0.01 on this system, where z is large in absolute value. (a) Suppose we need to compute f(z) for a thousand numbers, given in a vector x, and we store the results in a vector f. A short MATLAB script that does it is: for i=1:1000 f(i)=sqrt(x(i)~2+0.01)-sqrt(x(i)\"2-0.01); end Rewrite this script in a vectorized fashion, using a single MATLAB command. Make sure to write the command, particularly the operators that are involved, in the clearest possible way, large and clear, without any ambiguities. [1 mark]","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
