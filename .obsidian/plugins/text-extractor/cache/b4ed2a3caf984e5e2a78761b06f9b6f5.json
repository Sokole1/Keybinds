T T+ 16 This has two roots ¥ = (1++/1-12/16)/2 =1/4, 3/4. (b) We have to check p = |¢/(z*)|. Here ¢’(z) = 2z, so at the roots lg'(1/4)] = 5, 1¢/(3/4)| = 15> 1. The fixed point iteration will converge for the first root but not for the second. (If we want to be more rigorous we need to confirm that the function g is appropriately bounded near the solution; this is omitted.) (c) The rate of convergence near the first root is —log;, 0.5 = .3, so four iterations are required.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
