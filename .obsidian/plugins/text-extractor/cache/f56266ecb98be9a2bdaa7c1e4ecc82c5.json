There are k students interested in taking a course and each student is interested in some subset of the n possible courses. To manage costs, the college has a bound b on the number of courses it is willing to actually offer. Is there a way to choose b courses out of the n possibilities so that every student can take a course that interests them? Formally, an instance of the CS problem consists of e aset C of n possible courses, numbered 1 through n, e subsets 51,5, ..., Sk of {1,2,...,n} (the courses of interest to each of the students), and e a bound b (the maximum number of classes actually offered). The problem is to determine whether there is a subset B of {1,2,...,n}, where the size of B is < b, such that BN S; is not empty for all Â¢, 1 < i < k. 1. Show that the CS problem is in NP.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
