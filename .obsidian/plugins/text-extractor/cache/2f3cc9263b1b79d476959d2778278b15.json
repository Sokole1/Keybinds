December 2007 Math 215/255 Final Exam, All Sections Page 2 of 11 1.(10 points) A bath contains water. Let the depth of water at time t be y = y(t) ins. At time t = 0 the plug is pulled and water exits via the drain at the rate of 2y inches per minute. (a) The bath is ﬁlled to an initial depth of 10 inches. Find the depth y as a function of time. dy dt = −2y y = y0e−2t = 10e−2t (b) Same problem as in the previous part except that at time t = 0 the tap is turned on and water enters the bath at rate 3 inches per minute. dy dt = −2y + 3 dy dt e2t + 2ye2t = 3e2t d dt (e2ty) = 3e2t [e2sy(s) ]s=t s=0 = 3 2 [ e2s]t 0 e2ty(t) − 10 = 3 2 [e2t − 1] y(t) = 10e−2t + 3 2 [ 1 − e−2t] December 2007 Math 215/255 Final Exam, All Sections Page 3 of 11 2.(10 points) Consider t + ye 2ty + ate2ty dy dt = 0. (1) (a) Determine a such that (1) is exact. Denote M = t + ye2ty and N = ate2ty. My = e2ty(1 + 2ty), Nt = e2ty(a + 2aty) To be exact we need My = Nt. Thus a = 1. (b) Solve (1) when a has the value found in the previous part. ϕ(t, y) = ∫ M dt = 1 2 t2 + 1 2 e2ty + f (y). ϕy = 0 + te2ty + f ′(y) We need ϕy = N . Thus f ′ = 0 and ϕ = 1 2 t2 + 1 2 e 2ty + c. or y = 1 2t ln(c′ − t2).

Let f (x, y) = 1 − x − y and h = 0.1. We have the recursion formula y0 = 2, yk+1 = yk + h · f (kh, yk), k = 0, 1, 2, . . . Thus y1 = 2 + 0.1 · f (0, 2) = 2 + 0.1 · (−1) = 1.9. y2 = 1.9 + 0.1 · f (0.1, 1.9) = 1.9 + 0.1 · (−1) = 1.8. December 2007 Math 215/255 Final Exam, All Sections Page 5 of 11 4.

Noting that Im(λ1) ̸= 0 and Re(λ1) < 0 one can conclude that the trajectories are stable spirals. In order to ﬁgure out whether it is clockwise or counter-clockwise, plug the initial condition −→ X (0) = ( 0 1 ) in the initial system and obtain: −→ X ′(0) = ( −1/2 1 −1 −1/2 ) ( 0 1 ) = ( 1 −1/2 ) Therefore, x′(0) = 1 > 0 and y′(0) = −1/2 < 0. Therefore we deal with a clock wise spiral. The phase portrait is illustrated in the ﬁgure below.
