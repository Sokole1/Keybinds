Let C be the curve of intersection of the surfaces z = x + y and z = x2 + y2. Orient C such that it goes counter-clockwise when viewed from above. Compute ∫ C F · dr for (a) F = (x2, y2, 3e z) (b) F = (y2, x 2, 3e z) 2. Let R be the region in the ﬁrst quadrant of the xy-plane bounded by the coordinate axes and y = 1 − x2. Recall that ∂R is oriented counter-clockwise and ds = ds dt dt and ds dt = |v|. (a) Evaluate ∫ ∂R xds. (b) Evaluate ∫ ∂R F · dr for F = (sin(x2) − xy)ˆi + (x2 + cos y2)ˆj. 3. Let F = (x + 3y)ˆi + (x + y)ˆj and G = (x + y)ˆi + (2x − 3y)ˆj. Find the number A such that for each circle C in the plane, then ∫ C F · dr = A ∫ C G · dr. 4. Calculate the area ∫∫ dA inside the curve x2/3 + y2/3 = 1. 5. Evaluate the line integral ∫ C(x2 + ye x)dx + (x cos y + e x)dy where C is the arc of the curve x = cos y for −π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, traversed in the direction of increasing y.
