If ¯z = − 9 2|V | − 1, where |V | is the volume of V and ¯z is the z–component of the centroid (i.e. centre of mass with constant density) of V , then ∫∫ S F · ˆn dS = −9. One surface which obeys this condition is the unit cube (with outward normal) centred on (0, 0, − 11 2 ) . 8. (a) True (b) True (c) True (d) False (e) True (f) That depends. If κ = 0, the curve is part of a straight line. If κ > 0 it is part of a circle of radius 1 κ. (g) False (h) False (i) False","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":""}
