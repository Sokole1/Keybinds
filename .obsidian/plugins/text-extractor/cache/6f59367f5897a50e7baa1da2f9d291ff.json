We just formed an eigendecomposition or an SVD for A (the two are equivalent because A is SPD), and the largest singular value here is 02, Recall that the 2-norm of a matrix is its largest singular value, and this gives us the desired result. (b) From (a) with a small additional step it follows that r(A) = k3(G). (c) To be clear, the above does not fully establish that no pivoting is required. But it shows that there is no growth in the entries of the Cholesky factors. Fully showing that there is no need for pivoting is slightly subtle and requires arguments of the sort that appear on page 131 in the textbook. There is no need for you to be overly concerned about this.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
