That is, given an instance ¢ of SAT, SATISFIABLE(¢) outputs \"Yes\" if ¢ is satisfiable, and \"No\" otherwise. It will be convenient to assume that this procedure outputs \"Yes\" if the SAT instance has no clauses. Can we use this to find a satisfying assignment for ¢, if one exists? In what follows, suppose that ¢ is indeed a satisfiable instance of SAT, where the set of variables of ¢ is a subset of {z1,z2,...,z,}.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
