(consisting of points (21),2@) with 2 and o® both integers) Let X = (X1, X®) be a random vector which takes the values (1,0), (~1,0), (0,1), (0,~1) with equal probabilities 4. For j = 1,2, the marginal p.m.f. of X&) takes value 1 with probability 1, 1 with probability , and 0 with probability 3 Let X; be i.id. with the same distribution as X, and let §, = X, + X,.. Then S, represents the position after n steps of a random walker on Z2, starting from (0,0), whose random steps are equally likely to be any of the four unit vectors. (a) The expectation of a random vector ¥ = (Y1), Y®) is given by EY = (EYW, EY®) and the variance is given by Var(V) = E[(¥ EY) (¥ - EY)] with the ot indicating the ot product.
