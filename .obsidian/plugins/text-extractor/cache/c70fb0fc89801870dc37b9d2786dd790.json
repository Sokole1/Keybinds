The satellites are 480km from the surface of the earth. The speed of light is 3x10\"8 metres per second. Packets are 1350 bytes. The network has a transfer rate of 100Mbps. Assume the transmission delay for an ACK is Oms, and that the processing and queueing delays are 0. What is the one-way propagation delay for a bit in this network? number (rtol=0.01, atol=1e-08) ms @ What is the transmission delay for one packet? number (rtol=0.01, atol=1e-08) ms @ What is the total round-trip delay for one packet? number (rtol=0.01, atol=1e-08) ms @ Assume that you can transmit packets back-to-back. What is the throughput? number (rtol=0.01, atol=1e-08) Mbps @ Assume that you don't transmit the (n+1)th packet until you get a (very short) ACK for the nth packet. What is the throughput? number (rtol=0.01, atol=1e-08) Mbps @ Save & Grade Single attempt - Additional attempts available with new variants @","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
