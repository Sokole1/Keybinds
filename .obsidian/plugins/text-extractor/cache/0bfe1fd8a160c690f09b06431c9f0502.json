Here you may find the command scipy.stats.t.interval useful. If T\" has a Student t-distribution with &k degrees of freedom, then t . interval (alpha,k) will give you the interval containing alpha fraction of the probability mass. Submit your code and your computed confidence intervals. Note that you are treating the two data sets inde- pendently, so you are finding a different confidence interval for each data set; do not combine the two data sets.","libVersion":"0.2.1","langs":"eng"}
